## **Recommendations**

### **System**

- The current revision of SiWx917 has:
  - RAM memory of 672k bytes which can be shared between TA and M4 processors in SoC mode.
  - The below configurations are applicable in SoC mode and can be configured based on the application requirement. EXT_FEAT_352K_M4SS_320K is the default configuration, based on requirement EXT_FEAT_480K_M4SS_192K configuration is selected for SoC mode multi-protocol examples.
    - EXT_FEAT_480K_M4SS_192K - This mode configures TA with 480k and M4 with 192K bytes of memory
    - EXT_FEAT_416K_M4SS_256K - This mode configures TA with 416k and M4 with 256K bytes of memory
    - EXT_FEAT_352K_M4SS_320K - This mode configures TA with 352k and M4 with 320K bytes of memory
  - SoC mode should not use 672k_M4SS_0K memory configuration.
- Set the recommended Power Save Profile (PSP) type to Enhanced Max PSP.
- There are 2 Versions of Pro-Kits/Radio boards. Si917-6031A based on Si917-4338A (Rev **A01 - A11**) and SiWx917-6031A based on SiWx917-4338A (Rev A12). To get optimal power numbers, enable macro "SL_SI91X_ENABLE_LOWPWR_RET_LDO" pre-processor define for ICs or while using SiWx917-6031A Pro-kit, SiWx917-4338A version of boards. This macro should be disabled for earlier variant of board (Si917-6031A, Si917-4338A).
- With RAM configuration (EXT_FEAT_352K_M4SS_320K), only 352K memory is available to TA  which limits the features supported, Recommended to enable EXT_FEAT_416K_M4SS_256K in Wi-Fi + BLE Multi protocol mode to enable more Network features.
- For EXT_FEAT_416K_M4SS_256K  and EXT_FEAT_480K_M4SS_192K memory configurations, it is recommended to retain both TA and M4 RAMs in power save.

### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**

- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- For high throughput applications, aggregation (bit 2 of feature_bit_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode.
- Users can enable SL_SI91X_EXT_TCP_IP_SSL_16K_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in opermode for (HTTPS server) supporting 16k record.
- **TWT**
  - Recommendation is to use sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection() API for all TWT applications.
  - It is recommended to issue iTWT setup command once IP assignment, TCP connection, application specific socket connections are done.
  - When using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured. It's highly recommended to use sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection() as an alternative.
  - In case of TWT in coex mode, when using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API, use TWT wake duration &lt;= 16 ms and TWT wake interval &gt;= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
  - For iTWT GTK interval in AP should be configured to max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable on AP side, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API) or RX Latency (in case of sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API) is less than 4sec.
  - When sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wake interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
  - When using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API, it is recommended to set missed_beacon_count of sl_wifi_set_advanced_client_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Disable power save for high throughput applications or use FAST PSP power save mode as per application requirement.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp before establishing the SSL/EAP connection.
- The minimum timeout value should not be less than 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls.
- Please refer Keep alive intervals supported by MQTT broker and configure keep alive interval values accordingly.
- The minimum keep alive interval value recommended for embedded MQTT is 10 Seconds.
- Disable power save and suspend any active TWT sessions before triggering HTTP OTAF.
- Randomize the client port if using rapid connect/disconnect of the MQTT session on the same client port with the power save.
- Recommended to configure VAP_ID properly for Si91x STA and AP using sl_si91x_setsockopt_async(), in case of data transfer.
- Recommended to use valid length(<= 202 bytes) for topic to be published while using Embedded MQTT, else it leads to return wrong error code(0x21).

### **BLE**

- In BLE, the recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set_scan_params and create_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.

### **Multi-protocol**

- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning
  - All standard scan intervals are supported. For better scan results, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
  - BLE scanning will be stopped for intervals that collide with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Connections
  - All standard connection intervals are supported.
  - For a stable connection, use optimal connection intervals and max supervision timeout in the presence of Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Data Transfer
  - To achieve higher throughput for both Wi-Fi and BLE, use medium connection intervals, such as 45 to 80 ms with maximum supervision timeout.
  - Ensure Wi-Fi activity consumes lower intervals.

### **SDK**

- Observed Wi-Fi connection is successful even after deleting the stored network credentials using sl_net_delete_credential and responding with SL_NET_INVALID_CREDENTIAL_TYPE for sl_net_get_credential.
- Enhanced sl_wifi_get_firmware_version() API to provide more details (ROM ID, chip ID, security version, etc) which is not backward compatible with firmware older than 1711.2.10.1.0.0.4. Firmware binary notation does not include the security version number.
- In PSRAM enabled demos, moving of text, data and stack segments to PSRAM is allowed. BSS and Heap should still be in SRAM.
- Asynchronous Azure MQTT is not supported, this will be addressed in upcoming release(s).
- mDNS with IPV6 is not supported.
- Observing DUT is getting stuck while running MQTT publish with 2 different topics
- Observed MQTT RX is failing when continuous data sent every 1 second in aws_mqtt application

- Region selection based on country IE in the beacon is not supported
- Observed intermittent beacon reception from Access Point ( beacon misses) when channel congestion > 85%.

**Access Point (AP) Mode**

- Scan feature in AP mode not fully functional.
- Fixed rate configuration in AP mode using sl_wifi_set_transmit_rate API is not being set as expected.

**WPA2 Enterprise security (STA)**

- Observed connection issue with configuring certificate key and programming 4096 bit key and SHA384/SHA512 certificates.
- Observing DUT is throwing 0x1001c when configuring .data.certificate_key as "123456789".

- Less throughput observed in MU-MIMO with some APs that enabled LDPC.

**MU-MIMO (UL)**

- UL MU-MIMO is not supported.

**TWT**

- When sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time() API is used, occasional MQTT disconnections may be observed if TWT is configured with longer TWT intervals (>30secs) with embedded MQTT + TWT.  As an alternative, it's highly recommended to use sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection() API, where these dependencies are internally handled.

**Wi-Fi STA Rejoin**

- Observed Scanning (probe request) in all channels instead of the channels configured in selective channel(channel_bitmap_2g4) during rejoin process.

**IPv4/IPv6**

- IP change notification is not indicated to the application.

**BSD Socket API**

- Every server socket created consumes a socket (maximum of 10 sockets supported) and every subsequent connection to server socket consumes an additional socket (from the same pool of 10 sockets), which limits the number of server connections supported.
- Observed socket shutdown is not happening and DUT is getting stuck at  "prvCheckTasksWaitingTermination" while doing socket connection-> data transfer ->  socket shut down for multiple iterations.
- Observed DUT is not sending TCP retry packets on air when configured through setsockopt().

**Wi-Fi IOT Cloud integration**

-  **AWS IOT Core**
  - Observed AWS MQTT keepalive transmission is not happening at expected intervals with power save enabled.
- **AZURE IOT Core**
  - Observed DUT after sending the data, its not sending the MQTT keep alive packet due to this Azure HUB closing the connection.

**Wi-Fi Interoperability (IOP)**

## **Recommendations**

### **System**

- The current revision of SiWx917 has:
  - RAM memory of 672k bytes which can be shared between TA and M4 processors in SoC mode. 
  - The below configurations are applicable in SoC mode and can be configured based on the application requirement. EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K is the default configuration, based on requirement EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K configuration is selected for SoC mode multi-protocol examples.
    - EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K - This mode configures TA with 480k and M4 with 192K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K - This mode configures TA with 416k and M4 with 256K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K - This mode configures TA with 352k and M4 with 320K bytes of memory
  - SoC mode should not use 672k\_M4SS\_0K memory configuration.
- Set the recommended Power Save Profile (PSP) type to Enhanced Max PSP.
- There are 2 Versions of Pro-Kits/Radio boards. Si917-6031A based on Si917-4338A(Rev: A01 - A11) and SiWx917-6031A based on SiWx917-4338A(Rev: A12). To get optimal power numbers, enable macro "SL\_SI91X\_ENABLE\_LOWPWR\_RET\_LDO" pre-processor define for ICs or while using SiWx917-6031A Pro-kit, SiWx917-4338A version of boards. This macro should be disabled for earlier variant of board (Si917-6031A, Si917-4338A).
- With RAM configuration (EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K), only 352K memory is available to TA  which limits the features supported, Recommended to enable EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K in Wi-Fi + BLE Multi protocol mode to enable more Network features.
- For EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K  and EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K memory configurations, it is recommended to retain both TA and M4 RAMs in power save.

### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**

- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- For high throughput applications, aggregation (bit 2 of feature\_bit\_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode. 
- To reset TA (NWP), the application needs to call sl\_wifi\_deinit() followed by sl\_wifi\_init(). Users must ensure that no execution happens from flash at this point of time. (Refer to example applications) 
- Users can enable SL\_SI91X\_EXT\_TCP\_IP\_SSL\_16K\_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in opermode for (HTTPS server) supporting 16k record.
- **TWT**
  - Recommendation is to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() API for all TWT applications. 
  - It is recommended to issue iTWT setup command once IP assignment, TCP connection, application specific socket connections are done.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured. It's highly recommended to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() as an alternative.
  - In case of TWT in coex mode, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
  - For iTWT GTK interval in AP should be configured to max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable on AP side, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API) or RX Latency (in case of sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection API) is less than 4sec.
  - When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wake interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Disable power save for high throughput applications or use FAST PSP power save mode as per application requirement.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp before establishing the SSL/EAP connection.
- The minimum timeout value should not be less than 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. 
- Embedded MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- Disable power save and suspend any active TWT sessions before triggering HTTP OTAF.
- Randomize the client port if using rapid connect/disconnect of the MQTT session on the same client port with the power save.

### **BLE**

- In BLE, the recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set\_scan\_params and create\_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.

### **Multi-protocol**

- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning
  - All standard scan intervals are supported. For better scan results, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
  - BLE scanning will be stopped for intervals that collide with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Connections
  - All standard connection intervals are supported.
  - For a stable connection, use optimal connection intervals and max supervision timeout in the presence of Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Data Transfer
  - To achieve higher throughput for both Wi-Fi and BLE, use medium connection intervals, such as 45 to 80 ms with maximum supervision timeout.
  - Ensure Wi-Fi activity consumes lower intervals.

- Observed connection failures with some AP's in more channel congestion ~50-60% occupancy open lab environment.
- Region selection based on country IE in the beacon is not supported
- Observed intermittent beacon reception from Access Point ( beacon misses) in an extremely congested environment

**Access Point (AP) Mode**

- Scan feature in AP mode not fully functional. 
- Fixed rate configuration in AP mode using sl\_wifi\_set\_transmit\_rate API is not being set as expected. 

**WPA2 Enterprise security (STA)**

- Observed connection issue with configuring certificate key and programming 4096 bit key and SHA384/SHA512 certificates.
- Observing DUT is throwing 0x1001c when configuring .data.certificate\_key as "123456789".
- Configuration issue to program PAC file for EAP FAST Manual mode.
- Issue observed with WPA2 Enterprise Connectivity using Microsoft RADIUS Server.

**Wi-Fi Concurrency (AP + STA in same channel)**

- When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time() API is used, occasional MQTT disconnections may be observed if TWT is configured with longer TWT intervals (>30secs) with embedded MQTT + TWT.  As an alternative, it's highly recommended to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() API, where these dependencies are internally handled.

**Wi-Fi STA Rejoin**

- Observed Scanning (probe request) in all channels instead of the channels configured in selective channel(channel\_bitmap\_2g4) during rejoin process. 

**IPv4/IPv6**

- Observed issue with assigning static IP to DUT
- IP change notification is not indicated to the application. 

**BSD Socket API**

- Configuration issue to program TCP retry count (default 10) through setsockopt
- Every server socket created consumes a socket (maximum of 10 sockets supported) and every subsequent connection to server socket consumes an additional socket (from the same pool of 10 sockets), which limits the number of server connections supported.

## **Recommendations**

### **System**

- The current revision of SiWx917 has:
  - RAM memory of 672k bytes which can be shared between TA and M4 processors in SoC mode. 
  - The below configurations are applicable in SoC mode and can be configured based on the application requirement. EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K is the default configuration, based on requirement EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K configuration is selected for SoC mode multi-protocol examples.
    - EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K - This mode configures TA with 480k and M4 with 192K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K - This mode configures TA with 416k and M4 with 256K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K - This mode configures TA with 352k and M4 with 320K bytes of memory
  - SoC mode should not use 672k\_M4SS\_0K memory configuration.
- Set the recommended Power Save Profile (PSP) type to Enhanced Max PSP.
- There are 2 Versions of Pro-Kits/Radio boards.  Si917-6031A based on Si917-4338A and SiWx917-6031A based on SiWx917-4338A. To get optimal power numbers, enable macro "SL\_SI91X\_ENABLE\_LOWPWR\_RET\_LDO" pre-processor define for ICs or while using SiWx917-6031A Pro-kit, SiWx917-4338A version of boards. This macro should be disabled for earlier variant of board (Si917-6031A, Si917-4338A).
- With RAM configuration (EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K), only 352K memory is available to TA  which limits the features supported, Recommended to enable EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K in Wi-Fi + BLE Multi protocol mode to enable more Network features.
- For EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K  and EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K memory configurations, it is recommended to retain both TA and M4 RAMs in power save.

### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**

- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- For high throughput applications, aggregation (bit 2 of feature\_bit\_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode. 
- To reset TA (NWP), the application needs to call sl\_wifi\_deinit() followed by sl\_wifi\_init(). Users must ensure that no execution happens from flash at this point of time. (Refer to example applications) 
- Users can enable SL\_SI91X\_EXT\_TCP\_IP\_SSL\_16K\_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in opermode for (HTTPS server) supporting 16k record.
- **TWT**
  - Recommendation is to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() API for all TWT applications. 
  - It is recommended to issue iTWT setup command once IP assignment, TCP connection, application specific socket connections are done.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured. It's highly recommended to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() as an alternative.
  - In case of TWT in coex mode, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
  - For iTWT GTK interval in AP should be configured to max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable on AP side, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API) or RX Latency (in case of sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection API) is less than 4sec.
  - When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wake interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Disable power save for high throughput applications or use FAST PSP power save mode as per application requirement.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp before establishing the SSL/EAP connection.
- The minimum timeout value should not be less than 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. 
- Embedded MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- Disable power save and suspend any active TWT sessions before triggering HTTP OTAF.
- Randomize the client port if using rapid connect/disconnect of the MQTT session on the same client port with the power save.

### **BLE**

- In BLE, the recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set\_scan\_params and create\_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.

### **Multi-protocol**

- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning

**ADC**

- In ADC Multichannel, sampling rate is limited to less than 15Ksps. Number of samples is less than 500 and with a maximum of 4 channel
- In ADC Multichannel, when using different sampling rates for different channels behavior is not as expected
- ADC, ULP_ADC and ULP_ADC Multichannel applications are not printing float values in serial console.

**CT (Config Timer)**

- Config Timer(CT) support as an external event, in 32-bit mode, and DMA are not working as expected

**PWM**

- PWM Special event trigger for synchronizing analog-to-digital conversions is not working

**SYSRTC**

- SYSRTC with RO clock is not functioning

**Power Manager**

- The wakeup sources ULP-SSI, BOD, Comparator, and SysRTC are not working in the Power Manager service

### **SDK**

- Observed Wi-Fi connection is successful even after deleting the stored network credentials using sl\_net\_delete\_credential and responding with SL\_NET\_INVALID\_CREDENTIAL\_TYPE for sl\_net\_get\_credential.
- Enhanced sl\_wifi\_get\_firmware\_version() API to provide more details (ROM ID, chip ID, security version, etc) which is not backward compatible with firmwares older than 1711.2.10.1.0.0.4. Firmware binary notation does not include security version number.
- Matter applications are experiencing compatibility issues with WiseConnect SDK 3.1.2. It is recommended to use WiseConnect SDK 3.1.1 for matter-related applications. This will be addressed in up coming release(s).
- In PSRAM enabled demos, moving of text, data and stack segments to PSRAM is allowed. BSS and Heap should still be in SRAM.
- Asynchronous Azure MQTT is not supported, this This will be addressed in up coming release(s).

### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**

**Wi-Fi STA**

- STA Connection with the WPA3 Hunting and Pecking algorithm takes about 3-4 seconds.

**Access Point (AP) Mode**

- Scan feature in AP mode not fully functional. 
- Fixed rate configuration in AP mode using sl\_wifi\_set\_transmit\_rate API is not being set as expected. 

**WPA2 Enterprise security (STA)**

- Observed connection issue with configuring certificate key and programming 4096 bit key and SHA384/SHA512 certificates.
- Observing DUT is throwing 0x1001c when configuring .data.certificate\_key as "123456789".

## **Recommendations**

### **System**

- The current revision of SiWx917 has:
  - RAM memory of 672k bytes which can be shared between TA and M4 processors in SoC mode. 
  - The below configurations are applicable in SoC mode and can be configured based on the application requirement. EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K is the default configuration, based on requirement EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K configuration is selected for SoC mode multi-protocol examples.
    - EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K - This mode configures TA with 480k and M4 with 192K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K - This mode configures TA with 416k and M4 with 256K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K - This mode configures TA with 352k and M4 with 320K bytes of memory
  - SoC mode should not use 672k\_M4SS\_0K memory configuration.
- Set the recommended Power Save Profile (PSP) type to Enhanced Max PSP.
- There are 2 Versions of Pro-Kits/Radio boards.  Si917-6031A based on Si917-4338A and SiWx917-6031A based on SiWx917-4338A. To get optimal power numbers, enable macro "SL\_SI91X\_ENABLE\_LOWPWR\_RET\_LDO" pre-processor define for ICs or while using SiWx917-6031A Pro-kit, SiWx917-4338A version of boards. This macro should be disabled for earlier variant of board (Si917-6031A, Si917-4338A).
- With RAM configuration (EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K), only 352K memory is available to TA  which limits the features supported, Recommended to enable EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K in Wi-Fi + BLE Multi protocol mode to enable more Network features.
- For EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K  and EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K memory configurations, it is recommended to retain both TA and M4 RAMs in power save.

### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**

- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- For high throughput applications, aggregation (bit 2 of feature\_bit\_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode. 
- To reset TA (NWP), the application needs to call sl\_wifi\_deinit() followed by sl\_wifi\_init(). Users must ensure that no execution happens from flash at this point of time. (Refer to example applications) 
- Users can enable SL\_SI91X\_EXT\_TCP\_IP\_SSL\_16K\_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in opermode for (HTTPS server) supporting 16k record.
- **TWT**
  - Recommendation is to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() API for all TWT applications. 
  - It is recommended to issue iTWT setup command once IP assignment, TCP connection, application specific socket connections are done.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured. It's highly recommended to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() as an alternative.
  - In case of TWT in coex mode, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
  - For iTWT GTK interval in AP should be configured to max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable on AP side, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API) or RX Latency (in case of sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection API) is less than 4sec.
  - When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wake interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Disable power save for high throughput applications or use FAST PSP power save mode as per application requirement.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp before establishing the SSL/EAP connection.
- The minimum timeout value should not be less than 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. 
- Embedded MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- Disable power save and suspend any active TWT sessions before triggering HTTP OTAF.
- Randomize the client port if using rapid connect/disconnect of the MQTT session on the same client port with the power save.

### **BLE**

- In BLE, the recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set\_scan\_params and create\_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.

### **Multi-protocol**

- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning
  - All standard scan intervals are supported. For better scan results, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
  - BLE scanning will be stopped for intervals that collide with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Connections
  - All standard connection intervals are supported.
  - For a stable connection, use optimal connection intervals and max supervision timeout in the presence of Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Data Transfer
  - To achieve higher throughput for both Wi-Fi and BLE, use medium connection intervals, such as 45 to 80 ms with maximum supervision timeout.
  - Ensure Wi-Fi activity consumes lower intervals.

**UART**

- Flow control is not supported in USART and IOSTREAM applications

**ADC**

- In ADC Multichannel, sampling rate is limited to less than 15Ksps. Number of samples is less than 500 and with a maximum of 4 channel
- In ADC Multichannel, when using different sampling rates for different channels behavior is not as expected

**CT (Config Timer)**

- Config Timer(CT) support as an external event, in 32-bit mode, and DMA are not working as expected

**PWM**

- PWM Special event trigger for synchronizing analog-to-digital conversions is not working

**SYSRTC**

- SYSRTC with RO clock is not functioning

**Power Manager**

- The wakeup sources ULP-SSI, BOD, Comparator, and SysRTC are not working in the Power Manager service

### **SDK**

- Observed Wi-Fi connection is successful even after deleting the stored network credentials using sl\_net\_delete\_credential and responding with SL\_NET\_INVALID\_CREDENTIAL\_TYPE for sl\_net\_get\_credential.
- Observed sl\_net\_deinit is not returning any response for both "SL\_NET\_WIFI\_AP\_INTERFACE" and "SL\_NET\_WIFI\_CLIENT\_INTERFACE" interfaces, which requires to execute deinit code path to RAM in case of common flash.
- Enhanced sl\_wifi\_get\_firmware\_version() API to provide more details (ROM ID, chip ID, security version, etc) which is not backward compatible with firmwares older than 1711.2.10.1.0.0.4. Firmware binary notation does not include security version number.
- Matter applications are experiencing compatibility issues with WiseConnect SDK 3.1.2. It is recommended to use WiseConnect SDK 3.1.1 for matter-related applications. This will be addressed in up coming release(s).

### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**

**Wi-Fi STA**

- STA Connection with the WPA3 Hunting and Pecking algorithm takes about 3-4 seconds.
- Observed connection failures with some AP's in more channel congestion ~50-60% occupancy open lab environment.
- Region selection based on country IE in the beacon is not supported
- Observed intermittent beacon reception from Access Point ( beacon misses) in an extremely congested environment
- Note section in API documentation for sl\_wifi\_get\_sta\_tsf  needs to be corrected to "Returns error if station is not connected or at least one beacon is not received."

**Access Point (AP) Mode**

- Scan feature in AP mode not fully functional. 
- Fixed rate configuration in AP mode using sl\_wifi\_set\_transmit\_rate API is not being set as expected. 

**WPA2 Enterprise security (STA)**

- Observed connection issue with configuring certificate key and programming 4096 bit key and SHA384/SHA512 certificates.
- Observing DUT is throwing 0x1001c when configuring .data.certificate\_key as "123456789".

## **Recommendations**

### **System**

- The current revision of SiWx917 has:
  - RAM memory of 672k bytes which can be shared between TA and M4 processors in SoC mode. 
  - The below configurations are applicable in SoC mode and can be configured based on the application requirement. EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K is the default configuration, based on requirement EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K configuration is selected for SoC mode multi-protocol examples.
    - EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K - This mode configures TA with 480k and M4 with 192K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K - This mode configures TA with 416k and M4 with 256K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K - This mode configures TA with 352k and M4 with 320K bytes of memory
  - SoC mode should not use 672k\_M4SS\_0K memory configuration.
- Set the recommended Power Save Profile (PSP) type to Enhanced Max PSP.
- There are 2 Versions of Pro-Kits/Radio boards.  Si917-6031A based on Si917-4338A and SiWx917-6031A based on SiWx917-4338A. To get optimal power numbers, enable macro "SL\_SI91X\_ENABLE\_LOWPWR\_RET\_LDO" pre-processor define for ICs or while using SiWx917-6031A Pro-kit, SiWx917-4338A version of boards. This macro should be disabled for earlier variant of board (Si917-6031A, Si917-4338A).
- With RAM configuration (EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K), only 352K memory is available to TA  which limits the features supported, Recommended to enable EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K in Wi-Fi + BLE Multi protocol mode to enable more Network features.
- For EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K and EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K memory configurations, it is recommended to retain both TA and M4 RAMs in power save.

### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**

- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- For high throughput applications, aggregation (bit 2 of feature\_bit\_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode. 
- To reset TA (NWP), the application needs to call sl\_wifi\_deinit() followed by sl\_wifi\_init(). Users must ensure that no execution happens from flash at this point of time. (Refer to example applications) 
- Users can enable SL\_SI91X\_EXT\_TCP\_IP\_SSL\_16K\_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in opermode for (HTTPS server) supporting 16k record.
- **TWT**
  - Recommendation is to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() API for all TWT applications. 
  - It is recommended to issue iTWT setup command once IP assignment, TCP connection, application specific socket connections are done.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured. It's highly recommended to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() as an alternative.
  - In case of TWT in coex mode, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
  - For iTWT GTK interval in AP should be configured to max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable on AP side, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API) or RX Latency (in case of sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection API) is less than 4sec.
  - When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wake interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Disable power save for high throughput applications or use FAST PSP power save mode as per application requirement.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp before establishing the SSL/EAP connection.
- The minimum timeout value should not be less than 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. 
- Embedded MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- Disable power save and suspend any active TWT sessions before triggering HTTP OTAF.
- Randomize the client port if using rapid connect/disconnect of the MQTT session on the same client port with the power save.

### **BLE**

- In BLE, the recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set\_scan\_params and create\_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.

### **Multi-protocol**

- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning
  - All standard scan intervals are supported. For better scan results, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
  - BLE scanning will be stopped for intervals that collide with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Connections
  - All standard connection intervals are supported.
  - For a stable connection, use optimal connection intervals and max supervision timeout in the presence of Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Data Transfer
  - To achieve higher throughput for both Wi-Fi and BLE, use medium connection intervals, such as 45 to 80 ms with maximum supervision timeout.
  - Ensure Wi-Fi activity consumes lower intervals.

### **SDK**

- Observed Wi-Fi connection is successful even after deleting the stored network credentials using sl\_net\_delete\_credential and responding with SL\_NET\_INVALID\_CREDENTIAL\_TYPE for sl\_net\_get\_credential.
- Observed sl\_net\_deinit is not returning any response for both "SL\_NET\_WIFI\_AP\_INTERFACE" and "SL\_NET\_WIFI\_CLIENT\_INTERFACE" interfaces, which requires to execute deinit code path to RAM in case of common flash.
- Observed issue when NULL is passed for readfds, writefds, excepfds to socket select. 
- Enhanced sl\_wifi\_get\_firmware\_version() API to provide more details (ROM ID, chip ID, security version, etc) which is not backward compatible with firmwares older than 1711.2.10.1.0.0.4. Firmware binary notation does not include security version number.

### **Multi-protocol**

- **Enhancements**

  - Added support for alarm-based power save mode in wlan\_station\_ble\_provisioning\_with\_aws cloud example application.
  - Increased priority of Wi-Fi handling of data transmission in coex mode.
- **Fixed Issues**
  - Abrupt termination of HTTP download in the application when power save is enabled.
  - Firmware update fails with 0x7 error code when power save is enabled in wifi\_throughput\_ble\_dual\_role application.
  - Handling of PLL value in coex mode.
  - BLE disconnection issue after ~25-30 min while running Wi-Fi HTTP/HTTPs download along with BLE data transfer with power save enabled.

## **Recommendations**

### **System**

- The current revision of SiWx917 has:
  - RAM memory of 672k bytes which can be shared between TA and M4 processors in SoC mode. 
  - The below configurations are applicable in SoC mode and can be configured based on the application requirement. EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K is the default configuration, based on requirement EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K configuration is selected for SoC mode multi-protocol examples.
    - EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K - This mode configures TA with 480k and M4 with 192K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K - This mode configures TA with 416k and M4 with 256K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K - This mode configures TA with 352k and M4 with 320K bytes of memory
  - SoC mode should not use 672k\_M4SS\_0K memory configuration.
- Set the recommended Power Save Profile (PSP) type to Enhanced Max PSP.
- There are 2 Versions of Pro-Kits/Radio boards.  Si917-6031A based on Si917-4338A and SiWx917-6031A based on SiWx917-4338A. To get optimal power numbers, enable macro "SL\_SI91X\_ENABLE\_LOWPWR\_RET\_LDO" pre-processor define for ICs or while using SiWx917-6031A Pro-kit, SiWx917-4338A version of boards. This macro should be disabled for earlier variant of board (Si917-6031A, Si917-4338A).
- With RAM configuration (EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K), only 352K memory is available to TA  which limits the features supported, Recommended to enable EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K in Wi-Fi + BLE Multi protocol mode to enable more Network features.
- For EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K and EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K memory configurations, it is recommended to retain both TA and M4 RAMs in power save.

### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**

- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- For high throughput applications, aggregation (bit 2 of feature\_bit\_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode. 
- To reset TA (NWP), the application needs to call sl\_wifi\_deinit() followed by sl\_wifi\_init(). Users must ensure that no execution happens from flash at this point of time. (Refer to example applications) 
- Users can enable SL\_SI91X\_EXT\_TCP\_IP\_SSL\_16K\_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in opermode for (HTTPS server) supporting 16k record.
- **TWT**
  - Recommendation is to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() API for all TWT applications. 
  - It is recommended to issue iTWT setup command once IP assignment, TCP connection, application specific socket connections are done.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured. It's highly recommended to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() as an alternative.
  - In case of TWT in coex mode, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
  - For iTWT GTK interval in AP should be configured to max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable on AP side, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API) or RX Latency (in case of sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection API) is less than 4sec.
  - When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wake interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Disable power save for high throughput applications or use FAST PSP power save mode as per application requirement.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp before establishing the SSL/EAP connection.
- The minimum timeout value should not be less than 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. 
- Embedded MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- Disable power save and suspend any active TWT sessions before triggering HTTP OTAF.
- Randomize the client port if using rapid connect/disconnect of the MQTT session on the same client port with the power save.

### **BLE**

- In BLE, the recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set\_scan\_params and create\_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.

### **Multi-protocol**

- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning
  - All standard scan intervals are supported. For better scan results, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
  - BLE scanning will be stopped for intervals that collide with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Connections
  - All standard connection intervals are supported.
  - For a stable connection, use optimal connection intervals and max supervision timeout in the presence of Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Data Transfer
  - To achieve higher throughput for both Wi-Fi and BLE, use medium connection intervals, such as 45 to 80 ms with maximum supervision timeout.
  - Ensure Wi-Fi activity consumes lower intervals.

- Observed sl\_net\_deinit is not returning any response for both "SL\_NET\_WIFI\_AP\_INTERFACE" and "SL\_NET\_WIFI\_CLIENT\_INTERFACE" interfaces, which requires to execute deinit code path to RAM in case of common flash.
- Observed issue when NULL is passed for readfds, writefds, excepfds to socket select. 
- Enhanced sl\_wifi\_get\_firmware\_version() API to provide more details (ROM ID, chip ID, security version, etc) which is not backward compatible with firmwares older than 1711.2.10.1.0.0.4. Firmware binary notation does not include security version number.

## **Recommendations**
### **System**
- The current revision of SiWx917 B0 has:
  - RAM memory of 672k bytes which can be shared between TA and M4 processors in SoC mode. 
  - The below configurations are applicable in SoC mode and can be configured based on the application requirement By default EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K configuration will be selected in SoC mode

      - EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K - This mode configures TA with 480k and M4 with 192K bytes of memory
      - EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K - This mode configures TA with 416k and M4 with 256K bytes of memory
      - EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K - This mode configures TA with 352k and M4 with 320K bytes of memory
  - SoC mode should not use 672k\_M4SS\_0K memory configuration.
- Set the recommended Power Save Profile (PSP) type to Enhanced Max PSP.
- To get optimal power numbers for launch parts, enable SL\_SI91X\_ENABLE\_LOWPWR\_RET\_LDO pre-processor define. 
- With RAM configuration (EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K), only 352K memory is available to TA to support Wi-Fi + BLE with SSL, Recommended to enable EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K in Wi-Fi + BLE Multi protocol mode to enable more Network features.
### **IDE**
- Simplicity Studio. This release is tested with SV5.8.0 version.
- Refer to the latest version of the SoC "Getting-Started-with-SiWx917" guide for more details
### **Wi-Fi/Network Stack**
- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- Aggregation (bit 2 of feature\_bit\_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode. This enables software to aggregate multiple packets to achieve better throughput.
- TCP retransmission count value is recommended to be 30 or higher so that the TCP does not disconnect while the rejoin happens.
- To reset TA (NWP), the application needs to call sl\_wifi\_deinit() followed by sl\_wifi\_init(). Users must ensure that no execution happens from flash at this point of time. (Refer to example applications) 
- Users can enable SL\_SI91X\_EXT\_TCP\_IP\_SSL\_16K\_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in opermode for (HTTPS server) supporting 16k record.
- #### **TWT**
  - It is recommended to issue iTWT setup command once IP assignment, TCP connection, application specific socket connections are done.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured. It's highly recommended to use sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection() as an alternative.
  - In case of TWT in coex mode, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
  - For iTWT GTK interval in AP should be configured to max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable on AP side, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API) or RX Latency (in case of sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection API) is less than 4sec.
  - When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wake interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
  - When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wake\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Disable power save for high throughput applications or use FAST PSP powersave mode as per application requirement.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp when the feature is enabled before establishing the SSL/EAP connection.
- The minimum timeout value should not be less than 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. 
- Embedded MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- Disable power save and suspend any active TWT sessions before triggering HTTP OTAF.
- Randomize the client port if using rapid connect/disconnect of the MQTT session on the same client port with the power save.
### **BLE**
- In BLE, the recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set\_scan\_params and create\_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.
### **Multi-protocol**
- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning
  - All standard scan intervals are supported. For better scan results, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
  - BLE scanning will be stopped for intervals that collide with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Connections
  - All standard connection intervals are supported.
  - For a stable connection, use optimal connection intervals and max supervision timeout in the presence of Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Data Transfer
  - To achieve higher throughput for both Wi-Fi and BLE, use medium connection intervals, such as 45 to 80 ms with maximum supervision timeout.
  - Ensure Wi-Fi activity consumes lower intervals.

## **Recommendations**
**System**

- The current revision of SiWx917 B0 has:
  - RAM memory of 672k bytes which can be shared between TA and M4 processors in NCP/SoC mode. The following memory configuration modes are supported.
    - EXT\_FEAT\_672K\_M4SS\_0K- This mode configures TA with 672k and M4 with 0K bytes of memory which is applicable only in the case of NCP mode
  - The below configurations are applicable in SoC mode and can be configured based on the application requirement By default EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K configuration will be selected in SoC mode
    - EXT\_FEAT\_480K\_M4SS\_192K - This mode configures TA with 480k and M4 with 192K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_416K\_M4SS\_256K - This mode configures TA with 416k and M4 with 256K bytes of memory
    - EXT\_FEAT\_352K\_M4SS\_320K - This mode configures TA with 352k and M4 with 320K bytes of memory
  - The currently supported memory configuration for NCP mode is 672K\_M4SS\_0K.
  - SoC mode should not use 672k\_M4SS\_0k memory configuration.
- Set the recommended Power Save Profile (PSP) type to Enhanced Max PSP.

**IDE**

- Download the latest Simplicity Studio (SV5.7.0.1)
- Refer to the latest version of the SoC/NCP "Getting-Started-with-SiWx917" guide for more details

**Network Stack**

- The recommended embedded MQTT Publish payload is 1 kBytes.

**Wi-Fi**

- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- Aggregation (bit 2 of feature\_bit\_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode. This enables software to aggregate multiple packets to achieve better throughput
- TCP retransmission count value is recommended to be 30 or higher so that the TCP does not disconnect while the rejoin happens.
- To restart the module, the application needs to call sl\_wifi\_deinit() followed by sl\_wifi\_init().
- Register 'Join Fail Callback' function every time when join is called, as in the rejoin failure path the callback is deregistered. If not done, this might result in a scan not functioning on rejoin failure.
- User can enable SL\_SI91X\_EXT\_TCP\_IP\_SSL\_16K\_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature'bit map in opermode, if HTTPS download is failing after receiving HTTP headers..
- iTWT setup is recommended after IP assignment/TCP connection/application specific socket connections.
- When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured.
- In case of TWT+coex, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
- For iTWT GTK Interval Should be kept max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API) or RX Latency (in case of sl\_wifi\_target\_wake\_time\_auto\_selection API) is less than 4sec.
- Disable Power Save for High Throughput Applications.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp when the feature is enabled before establishing the SSL connection.
- The timeout value should not be less than 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. Timeout value of less than 1 second is not currently supported.
- When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wakeup interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
- Embedded MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.

**BLE**

- In BLE, the recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set\_scan\_params and create\_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.

**Co-Existence**

- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning
  - All standard scan intervals are supported. For better scan results, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
  - BLE scanning will be stopped for intervals that collide with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Connections
  - All standard connection intervals are supported.
  - For a stable connection, use optimal connection intervals and max supervision timeout in the presence of Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Data Transfer
  - To achieve higher throughput for both Wi-Fi and BLE, use medium connection intervals, such as 45 to 80 ms with maximum supervision timeout.
  - Ensure Wi-Fi activity consumes lower intervals.
## **Known Issues**
**Network Stack**

- Sometimes during SSL Handshake, ECC curve parameters generated are wrong, resulting in connection failure with BBD2 error. However, this recovers in the next attempt.
- Randomize the client port if using rapid connect/disconnect of the MQTT session on the same client port with the power save.
- Secure SSL renegotiation not supported in Embedded Networking Stack.

**Wi-Fi**

- DUT is not transmitting packets continuously over the air in BLE test modes.
- After connecting to the remote device using gatt\_test applications, GATT APIs could not be triggered. 
- DUT hangs during multiple iterations of BLE connect and disconnect tests with TA and M4 power enabled.

**Co-Existence**

- Observed HTTP continuous download is not happening in Powersave mode after BLE connection established using wifi\_https\_ble\_dual\_role application
- Observed DUT hang while Wi-Fi UDP Tx and BLE continuous scan run for long time.
- sl\_wifi\_init throws insufficient memory(0x2C) error, when low\_power\_mode feature is enabled in CoEx application with "TA\_352K\_M4SS\_320K" Memory configuration.

- I2C High speed mode not supported.
- Manual chip select option is not supported when using GSPI and SSI.

**Simplicity Studio and Commander**

- Default GDB debug configuration is not supported for SoC projects, work around details provided in "Getting-Started-with-SiWx917"

- In case of TWT+coex, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.
- For iTWT GTK Interval Should be kept max possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API) 
- Disable Power Save for High Throughput Applications.
- The application needs to ensure that it sets RTC with the correct timestamp when the feature is enabled before establishing the SSL connection.
- Timeout value should be minimum 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. Timeout value of less than 1 second is not currently supported.
- When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wakeup interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
- MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Secure OTA: Keys need to be programmed before validating Secure OTA

**BLE**

- In BLE, recommended range of Connection Interval in
  - Power Save (BLE Only) - 100 ms to 1.28 s.
- In BLE, during Connection, the configuration of Scan Interval and Scan Window with the same value is not recommended. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Scan Interval is 3:4.
- In BLE, if a device is acting as Central, the scan window (in set\_scan\_params and create\_connection commands) must be less than the existing Connection Interval. The suggested ratio of Scan Window to Connection Interval is 2:3.
- In BLE mode, if scanning and advertising are in progress on the SiWx91x module and it subsequently gets connected and moves to the central role, scanning stops else if it moves to the peripheral role, advertising stops. To further establish a connection to another peripheral device or to a central device, the application should give a command for starting advertising and scanning again.

**Co-Existence**

- For concurrent Wi-Fi + BLE, and while a Wi-Fi connection is active, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Advertising
  - All standard advertising intervals are supported. As Wi-Fi throughput is increased, a slight difference in on-air advertisements compared to configured intervals may be observed.
  - BLE advertising is skipped if the advertising interval collides with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE scanning
  - All standard scan intervals are supported. For better scan results, we recommend setting the ratio of the BLE scan window to BLE scan interval to 1:3 or 1:4.
  - BLE scanning will be stopped for intervals that collide with Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Connections
  - All standard connection intervals are supported.
  - For a stable connection, use optimal connection intervals and max supervision timeout in the presence of Wi-Fi activity.
- Wi-Fi + BLE Central/Peripheral Data Transfer
  - To achieve higher throughput for both Wi-Fi and BLE, use medium connection intervals, such as 45 to 80 ms with maximum supervision timeout.
  - Ensure Wi-Fi activity consumes lower intervals.

**Known Issues**

**Network Stack**

- Sometimes during SSL Handshake, ECC curve parameters generated are wrong, resulting in connection failure with BBD2 error. However, this recovers in the next attempt.

  - The currently supported memory configuration for NCP mode is 704K\_M4SS\_0K.
  - SoC mode should not use 704k\_M4SS\_0k Memory configuration.
  - In SoC mode, M4 power save will work with 384k TA and 320 M4 memory configuration only. It is not supported for "448K TA and 256k M4" and "512k TA and 192k M4" memory configurations.

**IDE**

- Download the latest Simplicity Studio (SV5.7.0.1)
- Refer to the latest version of the SoC "Getting-Started-with-SiWx917" guide for more details

**Wi-Fi**

- It is recommended to enable bit 16 of the 'Extended TCP IP Feature' bit map in the opermode command for all Wi-Fi Socket Operations from the host to ensure graceful handling during asynchronous closures from the peer.
- Aggregation (bit 2 of feature\_bit\_map) is recommended to be enabled in opermode. This enables sw to aggregate multiple packets to achieve better throughput
- TCP retransmission count value is recommended to be 30 or higher so that the TCP does not disconnect while the rejoin happens.
- To restart the module, the application needs to call sl\_wifi\_deinit() followed by sl\_wifi\_init().
- Register 'Join Fail Callback' function every time when join is called, as in the rejoin failure path the callback is deregistered. If not done, this might result in a scan not functioning on rejoin failure.
- User can enable SL\_SI91X\_EXT\_TCP\_IP\_SSL\_16K\_RECORD in 'Extended TCP IP Feature'bit map in opermode, if HTTPS download is failing after receiving HTTP headers..
- iTWT setup is recommended after IP assignment/TCP connection/application connection.
- When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured.
- In case of TWT+coex, when using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API, use TWT wake duration <= 16 ms and TWT wake interval >= 1 sec. If wake duration > 16 ms or TWT wake interval < 1sec, there might be performance issues.

- Timeout value should be minimum 1 second for socket select and socket receive calls. Timeout value of less than 1 second is not currently supported.
- When sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wakeup interval of less than or equal to 1 min.
- MQTT keep alive interval should be either 0 or a value greater than 35 seconds.
- When using sl\_wifi\_enable\_target\_wakeup\_time API, it is recommended to set missed\_beacon\_count of sl\_wifi\_set\_advanced\_client\_configuration API greater than 2 times of the configured TWT Interval.
- Secure OTA: Keys need to be programmed before validating Secure OTA

- BLE maximum two concurrent connections are supported, which can be either a connection to two peripheral devices, to one central and one peripheral device or two central devices.
- BLE Slave latency value is valid up to 32 only.
- BLE TX/RX throughput is less when tested with EFM as compared to EFR
- Maximum supported AE data length is 200 bytes.
- Supports only two ADV\_EXT sets.
- Supports only two BLE connections( 1 Central and 1 Peripheral) with AE.
- Filtering policy is not supported for Periodic advertising.

**MCU**

- ULP Peripherals examples configurations are for RAM-based execution, as flash is powered off in ULP Mode
- On 4338a board, two I2C instances(I2C1 and I2C2) are using same GPIOs ,so support is not there for using two I2C instances simultaneously
- I2C Fast and High speed mode not supported
- when using GSPI and SSI, manual chip select option not supported

**Simplicity Studio and Commander**

- Default GDB debug configuration is not supported for SoC projects, work around details provided in "Getting-Started-with-SiWx917"
