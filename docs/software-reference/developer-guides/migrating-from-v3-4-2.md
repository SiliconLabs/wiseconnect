## Overview

This guide outlines the steps required to migrate an existing application using the WiSeConnect™ SDK v3.4.2 to a v3.5.0 application.

There are few naming and file changes in v3.5.0 as compared to v3.4.2, mostly in order to standardize the names and improve the overall usage experience of the application programming interface (API). Migration requires the names everywhere to be updated in the existing application.

## Migration Steps

To convert a WiSeConnect SDK v3.4.2 application to a v3.5.0 application, complete the following steps:

1. Open your existing application project in Simplicity Studio.

2. In each source file of the project, replace the v3.4.2 names or interfaces with v3.5.0 names or interfaces.

Refer to the tables in the following sections that map the v3.4.2 API elements to v3.5.0 elements. In some cases, the differences between v3.4.2 and v3.5.0 are highlighted in **bold** text.


### Updated default TCP/IP thread priority in LWIP stack

As part of the migration from WiSeConnect™ SDK v3.4.2 to v3.5.0, there have been changes to the TCP/IP thread priority in the LWIP stack to ensure faster and more responsive handling of network operations.

**Reason for Change**

Currently, the TCP/IP thread priority is at `osPriorityIdle`. The TCP/IP thread's idle priority is causing issues with UDP data transfer, because it is unable to process the ARP response. This occurs because the application thread, with its higher priority, does not allow the TCP/IP thread sufficient processing time.

The ideal priority for the TCP/IP thread in the LWIP stack should be higher than application threads but lower than critical system threads (for example, bus and event threads).
To address this, we have updated the TCP/IP thread in LWIP priority to osPriorityNormal.

**User Impact**

Increasing the LWIP TCP/IP thread priority can affect the functionality of application threads, because their priorities are lower compared to the TCP/IP thread.

### Updated User Gain Table API

As part of the migration from WiSeConnect™ SDK v3.4.2 to v3.5.0, a new API `sl_wifi_update_su_gain_table` has been added for loading Wi-Fi user gain table values to get more gain in 11ax SU operations.

**Reason for Change**
This request aims to support at least two 11ax Power tables (SU and TB), because currently only one power table is supported. Due to this limitation, we are using lower TB-based power levels in 11ax, which reduces overall 11ax performance.

With current tests:

- ETSI/MIC TX powers are reduced by about ~6 dB for 11ax (limited by 26Tone RU - PSD).
- FCC Band edge for 26Tone RU is worse by up to ~2 dB compared to other 11ax cases.

  - With the new power table, we will be able to support both TB and SU side by side with two different power levels, without compromising the SU power table.
  - We should be able to support different levels or backoffs for various tones (26, 52, 106, and so on).
  - Supporting different backoffs based on the placement of 26-tone or 52-tone (whether center, edge of 20 MHz, and so on) is optional.

**User Impact**

Increased gain values as per mentioned above.

### Condition Introduced for Keeping Files in .data Section Based on pm_ps2_component

A condition has been introduced in release **3.5.0** to keep specific files in the `.data` section (RAM) **only if** the `pm_ps2_component` is installed.

- **Component Requirement:**  
  The `pm_ps2_component` must be installed when the application is designed to switch or manage PS2 power states.

- **Reason for Change:**  
  In previous releases, when the ULP wakeup sources components were used or installed, files related to PS2 functionality were unnecessarily placed in the `.data` section, causing **increased RAM usage** in applications that did not require PS2 features. This change optimizes RAM usage by including these files only when necessary.

- **Action Required:**  
  If your application uses PS2 power management, do one of the following:
  - Install the `pm_ps2_component` in **Simplicity Studio**,  
    **OR**
  - Add it to the `components` section of your `.slcp` file manually.
  
- **Note:**  
  Without this component, related files will no longer be moved to `.data` section, helping reduce RAM footprint for applications that do not use PS2 features.

  |-----------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
  | Wi-Fi     | `sl_wifi_performance_profile_t`                  | `sl_wifi_performance_profile_v2_t`                   |

### Updated Status Codes

As part of the migration from WiSeConnect™ SDK version v3.4.2 to v3.5.0, the status codes in `sl_additional_status.h` have been updated to avoid overlapping with the status codes in `sl_status.h`. The new status code values now include a prefix (`0x16`) for better categorization and to avoid conflicts.

**Reason for Change**

The status codes in `sl_additional_status.h` previously overlapped with those in `sl_status.h`, which could lead to conflicts and incorrect status handling. To resolve this, the status code values in `sl_additional_status.h` have been updated to use the range `0x16000` to `0x16FFF`.

**User Impact**

Applications using the old status codes will need to update their references to the new status code values. This change ensures compatibility with the v3.5.0 SDK and prevents conflicts between `sl_status.h` and `sl_additional_status.h`.
