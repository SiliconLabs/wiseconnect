description: >
  ULP Timer will works in ultra low power mode and is designed to consume very little power in comparison
  to regular timers. It allows a microcontroller to generate interrupt periodically or one time depending 
  on timer mode and can be configured either as a microsecond timer or as a counter depending on timer type.
  This driver has total 4 instances and by default it installs ULP-Timer-0.
  When you install this component, it will also be installing the  ULP-timer dependency component, 
  which is the ULP-timer driver's implementation.
