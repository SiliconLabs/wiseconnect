description: >
  The System Real-Time Clock (SYSRTC) driver provides precise timekeeping and timer capabilities required by a variety of applications. 
  It is required for activities such as accurate time measurement and scheduling an event. 
  The SYSRTC driver provides complete features for setting and running the peripheral, 
  ensuring high performance and reliability in time-critical applications.
  It supports two groups and each group have two compare channels and one capture channel. 
  It saves power by letting all groups share a single counter. And this also supports ULP and UULP power domain.
  When you select this component, it will also be installing the  SYSRTC  dependency component, 
  which is the SYSRTC driver's implementation.
