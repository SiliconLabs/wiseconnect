description: >
  The DAC Drivers can write at up to 5 Msps with a 10-Bit resolution. 
  There are two types of data sampling functions: blocking and non-blocking.  
  Non-blocking write data functions use DMA (FIFO mode) to write data 
  and notify completion via callback functions.
  DAC peripheral can also be run in ULP mode.
  
  When you install this component, it will also be installing the  DAC Core dependency, which is the DAC driver's implementation.
