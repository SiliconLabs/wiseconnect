description: >
  I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is another serial communication protocol. 
  It facilitates communication between multiple devices over just two lines: a data line (SDA - Serial Data) 
  and a clock line (SCL - Serial Clock).
  The I2C will be configured in leader mode. The SCL and SDA lines of leader controller are
  connected to Follower's SCL and SDA pins.
  There are three configurable I2C Master/Slave controllers in M4 - two in the MCU HP peripherals (I2C0, I2C1) 
  and I2C2 in the MCU ULP subsystem (ULP_I2C).

  Note:
  For Configuring, Configurable Parameters of I2C, open the configuration wizard and configure, Below are the Configurable Parameters of I2C:
    - Instance Mode
    - Instance Operating Mode
    - Instance Transfer Type

  I2C Supports instances.
  Instances created must be named as I2C0, I2C1, I2C2. 

  Note: When utilizing the I2C2 (ULP_I2C) instance in high power mode with DMA enabled, it is advisable to allocate buffers in the ULP Memory block. 
  For further details on buffer allocation, please refer to the ULP I2C Driver Leader example.
