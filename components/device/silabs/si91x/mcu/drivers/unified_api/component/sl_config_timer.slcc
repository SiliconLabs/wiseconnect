description: >
  Configurable timers driver can be used for modulated signal output, event capture on
  the GPIOs in input mode, and clock and event counting.
  They can be configured to generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) output,
  In accordance with the ON and OFF periods that are programmed.
  Config timer will trigger interrupt on occurance of an event or reaching 
  match count value and notifies via callback functions.
  When you install this component, it will also be installing the  Config timer dependency component, 
  which is the Config timer driver's implementation.
