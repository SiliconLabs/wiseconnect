  I2S, which stands for Inter-IC Sound or Integrated Interchip Sound, is a 
  serial bus interface standard used for connecting digital audio devices. 
  Unlike I2C or SPI, I2S is specifically designed for transferring audio data 
  between integrated circuits (ICs).

  The pins like CLK, FRAME, DIN, DOUT are used for transmitting and receiving the data 
  in full duplex communication from master to target.
  Offering non-blocking send and receive functions. 

  When you install this component, it will also be installing the  I2S dependency component, 
  which is the I2S driver's implementation.

  Note: When utilizing the I2S1 instance in high power mode with DMA enabled, it is advisable to allocate buffers in the ULP Memory block. 
  For further details on buffer allocation, please refer to the ULP I2S example.
