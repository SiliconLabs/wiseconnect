label: HRNG - Hardware Random Number Generator
package: platform
description: The HRNG driver enables the generation of true random and pseudo-random numbers. 
  It supports secure applications requiring high-quality randomness, such as cryptographic functions. 
  The driver offers APIs for starting, stopping, and retrieving random data from the HRNG peripheral. 
  It operates in two modes ie, true random generation for enhanced security and pseudo-random for standard applications.
