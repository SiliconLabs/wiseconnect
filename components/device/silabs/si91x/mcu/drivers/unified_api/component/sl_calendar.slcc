description: >
  The calendar driver will set the day and time for the RTC. 
  When activated, it can also generate triggers for second and millisecond timeouts. 
  Once the date and time have been set, the RTC will maintain them until the next power cycle.
  It also supports ULP and  UULP power domain.
  When you install this component, it will also be installing the  Calendar dependency component, 
  which is the calendar driver's implementation.
