description: >
  The ADC Drivers can read at up to 2.5 Msps with a 12-Bit resolution. 
  It supports 16 channel instances. 
  There are two types of data sampling functions: blocking and non-blocking.  
  Non-blocking read data functions use DMA (FIFO mode) to read data 
  and notify completion via callback functions.
  When Default creates an instance, it installs channel 1.
  It is also feasible to run all instances in ULP mode.
 
  When you install this component, it will also be installing the ADC dependency component, which is the ADC driver's implementation.
