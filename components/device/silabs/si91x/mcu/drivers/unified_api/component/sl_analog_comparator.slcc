description: >
  An analog comparator in a microcontroller is a peripheral that compares two analog input voltages
  and generates interrupt if non-inverting input is higher then inverting input.
  It typically has two input pins for comparing analog voltages. There are 9 possible inputs for 
  each pin of comparator, and 2 of the 9 are external pin inputs (GPIOs).
  It can compare external pin inputs, external pin input to internal voltages and internal voltages.
  It  supports 2 instances.
  When create an instance by default, comparator-2 will get installed.
  When you install this component, it will also be installing the  analog comparator dependency component, 
  which is the analog comparator driver's implementation.
