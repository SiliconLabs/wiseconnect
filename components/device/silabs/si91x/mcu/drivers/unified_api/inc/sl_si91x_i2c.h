* Fast Mode Plus (1 Mbps), and High-Speed Mode (3.4 Mbps).
* 7 or 10-bit addressing.
* 7 or 10-bit combined format transfers.
* Support for clock synchronization and bus clear.
* Programmable SDA hold time.
* Integrated transmit and receive buffers with support for DMA.
* Bulk transmit mode in I2C slave mode.

 *
 * @section I2C_Intro Introduction
 *
* Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C) is a serial communication protocol widely used in microcontrollers and integrated circuits
* for communication between various peripheral devices and sensors. I2C uses only two wires: a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL),
* making it efficient in terms of pin usage, especially in systems with limited pin counts.
 * 
 * @image html i2c_frame.png "I2C Frame Format"
 * 
 * I2C is favored in embedded systems for its simplicity, flexibility, and low pin count requirements. Common use cases include:
 * - **Sensor Integration**: Connecting various sensors for data collection.
 * - **Sensor Hubs and Fusion Algorithms**: Combining sensor data for enhanced applications.
 * - **Memory Expansion**: Adding EEPROMs or other memory devices.
 * - **Real-Time Clock (RTC)**: Maintaining accurate timekeeping.
 * - **Display Interfaces**: Driving LCDs and other display modules.
 * - **Peripheral Control**: Managing additional peripheral devices.
 * - **Communication with Other Microcontrollers and Modules**: Enabling inter-device communication.
 * - **System Configuration and Control**: Configuring system settings and parameters.
 *
 * @section I2C_Configuration Configuration
 *
 * I2C can be configured using several parameters, including:
 * - **Mode**: Leader or Follower mode (sl_i2c_mode_t)
 * - **Transfer Type**: Using interrupts or DMA (@ref sl_i2c_transfer_type_t)
 * - **Operating Speed**: Various speed modes (@ref sl_i2c_operating_mode_t)
 *
 * These configurations are encapsulated in the @ref sl_i2c_config_t structure and initialized using the @ref sl_i2c_driver_init() API.
 *
 * For more details on configuration parameters, see the respective peripheral example readme document.
 *
 * @section I2C_Usage Usage
 * 
 * After defining the I2C configuration structures and passing an instance of @ref sl_i2c_config_t, the common I2C functions can be used to initiate and configure the I2C module. The typical flow for implementation is as follows:
 * 
 * - Initialize the I2C driver: @ref sl_i2c_driver_init
 * - Set the follower address (if in follower mode): @ref sl_i2c_driver_set_follower_address
 * - Configure the FIFO threshold: @ref sl_i2c_driver_configure_fifo_threshold
 * - Perform data operations:
 *   - Blocking mode use below APIs:
 *     - **Receive data:** @ref sl_i2c_driver_receive_data_blocking
 *     - **Send data:** @ref sl_i2c_driver_send_data_blocking
 *   - Non-blocking mode (Recommended for larger buffers):
 *     - **Receive data:** @ref sl_i2c_driver_receive_data_non_blocking
 *     - **Send data:** @ref sl_i2c_driver_send_data_non_blocking
 * - Deinitialize the I2C driver: @ref sl_i2c_driver_deinit
 * 
 * - **Recommendations:**
 * 
 *   - For larger buffer transfers (greater than 16 bytes), prefer non-blocking APIs to avoid stalling the CPU, especially in high-throughput applications.
 *   - When using non-blocking APIs, ensure that the transfer type is configured as SL_I2C_USING_DMA to leverage DMA for efficient data handling.
 *   - When using blocking APIs, ensure that the transfer type is configured as SL_I2C_USING_INTERRUPT.
