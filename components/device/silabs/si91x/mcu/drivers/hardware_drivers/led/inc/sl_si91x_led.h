*  @section led_intro Introduction
* 
* The SI91x LED driver is a platform-level software module designed to manage LED control.
* All LED functions are accessed through the generic driver, which then internally calls the LED-specific functions.
* 
* @section led_config Configuration
* 
* All LED instances are configured with an sl_led_t struct. This struct along with a function definition for initializing LED is automatically generated when an LED is set up using Simplicity Studio's wizard.
* This struct sl_led_t struct is automatically generated into the following files sl_si91x_led_instances.h and sl_si91x_led_instances.c.
* The samples below are for a single instance called "led0".
* 
* @code{.c}
* // sl_si91x_led_instances.c
*
* #include "sl_si91x_led.h"
* #include "sl_si91x_led_config.h"
* #include "sl_si91x_led_instances.h"
* sl_led_t const led_led0 = {
*  .port = SL_LED_LED0_PORT,
*  .pin = SL_LED_LED0_PIN,
*  .led_number = SL_LED_LED0_NUMBER,
* };
*
* void led_init_instances(void)
* {
*   sl_si91x_led_init(&led_led0);
* }
* @endcode
*
* @note The sl_si91x_led_instances.c file is shown with only one instance, but if more were in use they would all appear in this .c file.
*  
* @code{.c}
* // sl_si91x_led_instances.h
*
* #ifndef SL_SI91x_LED_INSTANCES_H
* #define SL_SI91x_LED_INSTANCES_H
* 
* #include "sl_si91x_led.h"
* 
* extern const sl_led_t led_led0;
* 
* void led_init_instances(void);
* 
* #endif // SL_SI91x_LED_INSTANCES_H
* @endcode
* 
* @note The sl_si91x_led_instances.h file is shown with only one instance, but if more were in use they would all appear in this .h file.
* 
* - For more information on configuring available parameters, see the respective peripheral example readme document and
*  [Peripheral Configuration](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/disable-uc-config).
*
*  @section led_usage Usage
* 
*  After the LED structures are defined, the LED functions can be called by passing an instance of sl_led_t,
*  which will internally redirect to the type-specific version of the function.
*  The commonly used functions include the following:
* 
*  1. It configure GPIOs pertaining to the control of LEDs
*     and to initialize the selected LED GPIO and mode: @ref sl_si91x_led_init
*  2. This atomically wraps an XOR or a similar operation
*     for a single GPIO pin connected to an LED to toggle the LED: @ref sl_si91x_led_toggle
*  3. To set a GPIO pin connected to an LED to turn the LED on: @ref sl_si91x_led_set
*  4. To clear a GPIO pin connected to an LED to turn the LED off: @ref sl_si91x_led_clear
*
* @ref sl_si91x_led_init initialises the specific LED. This function is called automatically when the application is run.
*  
* @ref sl_si91x_led_toggle can be implemented by the application, if required. This function is used
* to toggle the state of the LED. @ref sl_si91x_led_set and @ref sl_si91x_led_clear both can be implemented by the application.
* These functions are used to turn the LED on and off resectively.
