*    @section buttondrv_intro Introduction
*
*   The SI91x button driver is a platform-level software module designed to manage button initialization
*   and reading. It provides a wide range of functions for handling button operations, such as 
*   initialization, state monitoring, and callback management for state changes. The driver
*   supports flexible interrupt configurations, allowing detection based on button state, edge 
*   transitions, or a combination of both. All button functions are accessed via the generic driver,
*   which internally calls specific functions for the corresponding button.
*
*    @section buttondrv_config Configuration
*
*   All button instances are configured using the @ref sl_button_t struct. This struct along with a function definition for initializing Button is automatically generated when an Button is set up using Simplicity Studio's wizard.
*   This struct @ref sl_button_t struct is automatically generated into the following files sl_si91x_button_instances.h and sl_si91x_button_instances.c.
*   The samples below are for a single instance called "btn0".
*
* @code{.c}
* // sl_si91x_button_instances.c
* #include "sl_si91x_button_pin_config.h"
* #include "sl_si91x_button_instances.h"
* #include "sl_si91x_button_btn0_config.h"
* 
* sl_button_t const button_btn0 = {
*   .port = SL_BUTTON_BTN0_PORT,
*   .pin = SL_BUTTON_BTN0_PIN,
*   .button_number = SL_BUTTON_BTN0_NUMBER,
*   #ifdef SL_BUTTON_BTN0_PAD
*   .pad = SL_BUTTON_BTN0_PAD,
*   #endif
*   .interrupt_config = SL_BUTTON_CONFIG_BTN0_INTR
* };
* 
* void button_init_instances(void)
* {
*   sl_si91x_button_init(&button_btn0);
* }
* @endcode
* @note The sl_si91x_button_instances.c file is shown with only one instance, but if more were in use they would all appear in this .c file.
*  
* @code{.c}

* 
* 
* void button_init_instances(void);
* void sl_simple_button_init_instances(void);
* 
* #endif // BUTTON_INSTANCES_H
* @endcode
* 
* @note The sl_si91x_button_instances.h file is shown with only one instance, but if more were in use they would all appear in this .h file.
* 
* - For more information on configuring available parameters, see the respective peripheral example readme document and
*   [Peripheral Configuration](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/disable-uc-config).
*
*    @section buttondrv_usage Usage
*
*   After the button structures are defined, button functions can be called by passing an instance of 
*   sl_button_t, which will internally redirect to the type-specific version of the function.
*   The commonly used functions include the following:
*
*   1. To initialize the button: @ref sl_si91x_button_init 
*   2. To return the current state (pressed or released) of the pin associated with a button: @ref sl_si91x_button_pin_state 
*   3. To toggle the value of a local variable associated with the state of button: @ref sl_si91x_button_state_toggle   
*   4. A callback that user can modify for the application: @ref sl_si91x_button_isr  
*
*   The @ref sl_si91x_button_init function is automatically invoked when the application starts.
*
*   The button driver supports interrupt mode, with or without debounce functionality.The application can
*   implement @ref sl_si91x_button_pin_state to determine the current state of the button when needed. 
*   Additionally, @ref sl_si91x_button_state_toggle can be implemented by the application to toggle the 
*   "soft" state, enabling interrupts and their callbacks. The @ref sl_si91x_button_isr is a callback 
*   function triggered by a change in the button's state, and the application can implement this 
*   function to define the desired actions upon a state change.
