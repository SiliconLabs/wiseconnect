description: >
  ULP Calendar component will enable Calendar in the low-power mode. It moves all the peripheral dependencies to RAM. 
  It also installs the peripheral component if already not installed. 
  As this is a NPSS peripheral, it also contributes to the wakeup source handler if the wakeup source config component 
  is installed. It initializes the wakeup source as per the selection in Wakeup Source Configuration UC.
  This component can be used for ultra-low power state also.
