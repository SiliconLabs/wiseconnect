label: Little FS for common flash parts with external flash
package: platform
description: >
  A little fail-safe filesystem. This component is used for performing file operations on common flash parts with external flash connected on GPIO_46 to GPIO_51 for common flash parts. 
  Configure SL_LITTLEFS_BASE_EXT in sl_si91x_littlefs_ext_flash_config.h file to indicate start address for littlefs region in external connected flash.
  note: QSPI2 peripheral is used to access the external flash. External flash base address starts from 0xA000000. For example, external flash physical address 0x00000000 translates to 0x0A000000.
