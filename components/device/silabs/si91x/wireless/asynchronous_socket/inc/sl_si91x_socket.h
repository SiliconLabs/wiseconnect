 *   Specifies the communication domain for the socket. This selects the protocol family to be used. 
 *   Accepts values from @ref BSD_SOCKET_FAMILIY. Currently, only @ref AF_INET and @ref AF_INET6 are supported.
 *
 * @param[in] type 
 *   Specifies the type of the socket, which determines the semantics of communication. 
 *   Accepts values from @ref BSD_SOCKET_TYPES. Currently, only @ref SOCK_STREAM and @ref SOCK_DGRAM are supported.

/**
 * @brief 
 * The sl_si91x_select() function is used to monitor multiple file descriptors for readiness to
 * perform I/O operations.  The file descriptors in the sets are monitored to
 * see if they are ready for reading, ready for writing, or have an error
 * condition pending.  
 * @details 
 * sl_si91x_select() allows a program to monitor multiple file descriptors, 
 * waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become "ready" 
 * for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible).  A file 
 * descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform a 
 * corresponding I/O operation without blocking. 
 * 
 * @param[in] nfds 
 *  The first nfds descriptors are checked in each set; that is, the descriptors from 0 through nfds-1.
 * @param[in,out] readfds 
 *  A pointer to a fd_set object that specifies the descriptors to check for files that are ready for reading.
 * @param[in,out] writefds 
 *  A pointer to a fd_set object that specifies the descriptors to check for files that are ready for writing.
 * @param[in,out] exceptfds 
 *  A pointer to a fd_set object that will be watched for exceptions.
 * @param[in] timeout 
 *  If timeout is provided, the device shall wait for timeout duration for the file descriptors to become ready.
 *  If timeout is NULL, the device shall wait indefinitely for the file descriptors to become ready.
 * @param[in] callback 
 *  A function pointer of type @ref sl_si91x_socket_select_callback_t that will be called when an asynchronous response  is received for a select request.
 * @return 
 *  If callback is provided, the function will immediately return zero for success, and -1 for failure.
 *  If callback is NULL, returns:
 *  - total number of file descriptors set on success.
 *  - 0 when no file descriptors are ready within the specified timeout.
 *  - -1 on failure.
 * 
 * @note 
 * The select function modifies the sets passed to it, so if the function
 * is to be called again, the sets must be reinitialized.
 * The exceptfds parameter is not currently supported.
