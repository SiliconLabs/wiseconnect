 * @brief
 *   Send an ICMP ping request to a specific IP address.
 * @details
 *   This function sends an ICMP ping request to a specific IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) with a user defined ping packet size.
 *   It verifies the deviceâ€™s initialization status and validates the IP address type before sending the request to the specific IP address.
 * @pre Pre-condition:
 *  - [sl_net_init](../wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-nwk-mgmt/net-interface-functions#sl-net-init) should be called before this API.
 * @param[in] ip_address
 *   The destination IP address should be of type [sl_ip_address_type_t](../wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-common/sl-ip-address-t) either IPv4 or IPv6.
 * @param[in] ping_packet_size
 *   The ping packet size is defined, with a valid range of [0, 300].
 * @return
 *   [sl_status_t](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/latest/platform-common/status) - Status of the operation.
 *   - SL_STATUS_OK: Operation successful.
 *   - SL_STATUS_NOT_INITIALIZED: Device is not initialized.
 *   - SL_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER: Invalid IP address type.
 * 
 * @note This is an asynchronous API. The response is recieved via [sl_net_event_handler_t](../wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-nwk-mgmt/sl-net-types#sl-net-event-handler-t) with [SL_NET_PING_RESPONSE_EVENT](wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-nwk-mgmt/sl-net-constants#sl-net-event-t) as event.
