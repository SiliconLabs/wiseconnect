 * Each of these configurations changes the behavior of how GRANT is asserted in response to REQUEST and PRIORITY signals.
 *

 *
 * | Configuration            |          Description                |
 * |:-------------------------|:------------------------------------|
 * | Configuration 1          | PTA Main would aggressively assert GRANT if the REQUEST is asserted irrespective of PRIORITY being asserted or not. This would mean any ongoing Wi-Fi transmission would be aborted, and GRANT would be provided to the PTA secondary. |
 * | Configuration 2          | PTA Main would aggressively assert GRANT if the REQUEST is asserted irrespective of PRIORITY being asserted or not, with only one exception of an ongoing ACK/Block ACK Transmission in response to a Wi-Fi reception. If there is an ongoing ACK/Block ACK transmission in response to a Wi-Fi Reception, PTA MAIN would GRANT access if PRIORITY is asserted along with REQUEST. |
 * | Configuration 3          | If there is an ongoing Wi-Fi Transmission (whih includes ACK/BLOCK ACK), then PTA MAIN would not assert GRANT to an asserted REQUEST. However, if PRIORITY and REQUEST are asserted, PTA MAIN would assert GRANT. |
 * 
 * The below configuration describes the pin connections between the EFR32MG21 and the SiW91x device that involves the GRANT, REQUEST, and PRIORITY signal.
 * 0 kept reserved for future. 3-Wire used at DUT are GPIO_7(Grant pin driven by DUT), ULP_GPIO_1(Request i/p pin for DUT) and ULP_GPIO_6(Priority i/p pin for DUT).
