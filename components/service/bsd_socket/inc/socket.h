 * @brief
 *   Set options on a socket.
 * 
 * @details
 *   The @ref setsockopt() system call manipulates the options associated with a socket. Options may exist at multiple protocol levels; 
 *   they are always present at the uppermost "socket" level. When manipulating socket options, the level at which the option resides 
 *   and the name of the option must be specified. To manipulate options at the socket level, `option_level` is specified as `SOL_SOCKET`. 
 *   To manipulate options at any other level, the protocol number of the appropriate protocol controlling the option is supplied. 
 *   For example, to indicate that an option is to be interpreted by the TCP protocol, `option_level` should be set to the protocol number of TCP. 
 *   The `option_value` and `option_length` arguments are used to access option values for @ref setsockopt().
 * 
 * @param[in] socket_id
 *   The socket ID or file descriptor for the specified socket.
 * 
 * @param[in] option_level
 *   The level at which the option is being set. One of the values from @ref BSD_SOCKET_OPTION_LEVEL.
 * 
 * @param[in] option_name
 *   The option to be configured. Accepts values from @ref BSD_SOCKET_OPTION_NAME. 
 *   Currently, following options are supported:
 *   - @ref SO_RCVTIMEO
 *   - @ref SO_KEEPALIVE
 *   - @ref SO_MAX_RETRANSMISSION_TIMEOUT_VALUE
 *   - @ref TCP_ULP

 *   - @ref SL_SO_HIGH_PERFORMANCE_SOCKET
 *   - @ref SL_SO_TLS_SNI
 *   - @ref SL_SO_TLS_ALPN
 *  
 * @param[in] option_value
 *   A pointer to the buffer containing the value for the option. Most socket-level options utilize an `int` argument for `option_value`. 
 *   For boolean options, set option_value to a non-zero value to enable the option or to zero to disable it. For non-boolean options, option_value should contain the specific data required for the option.
 *   The value of the parameter.
