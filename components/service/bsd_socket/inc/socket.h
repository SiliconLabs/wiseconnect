 * 
 * @pre Pre-conditions:
 * - The Wi-Fi/Net stack must be initialized and a network profile (STA or AP) must be up.

 * 
 * @param[in] protocol
 *   Specifies a particular protocol to be used with the socket. Normally, only a single protocol exists to support a particular socket type

 * @brief
 *   Bind a name to a socket.
 * 
 * @details
 *   When a socket is created with `socket()`, it exists in a namespace (address family) but, has no address assigned to it. 
 *   The `bind()` function assigns the address specified by `addr` to the socket referred to by the file descriptor `socket_id`.  
 *   Traditionally, this operation is called "assigning a name to a socket".
 * 
 *   It is normally necessary to assign a local address using `bind()` before a `SOCK_STREAM` socket may receive connections.
 * 
 * @pre Pre-conditions:
 * - @p socket_id must be a valid descriptor returned by @ref socket().
 * - @ref bind() must be called before @ref listen() on a TCP server socket and before sending/receiving on a UDP socket that needs a fixed local port.
 *
 * @post Post-conditions:
 * - On success the socket is associated with the supplied local address/port.
 * - On failure the socket remains unbound; @c errno is set.
 *
 * @param[in] socket_id
 *   The socket ID or file descriptor for the specified socket.
 * 
 * @param[in] addr 
 *   Pointer to a @ref sockaddr structure containing the address to be assigned to the socket.
 *   Must be non-NULL and @c sa_family must match the family used in @ref socket().
 * 
 * @param[in] addr_len 
 *   The `addr_len` parameter specifies the size, in bytes, of the address structure pointed to by `addr`.
 *   Must be @c sizeof(struct sockaddr_in) for IPv4 or @c sizeof(struct sockaddr_in6) for IPv6.
 * 
 * @return
 *   Returns 0 if successful. Otherwise, returns -1 and sets the global variable `errno` to indicate the error.
 *
 * @retval 0                 Success.
 * @retval -1/EBADF         @p socket_id is not a valid descriptor.
 * @retval -1/ENOTSOCK      @p socket_id refers to a non-socket file descriptor.

 * @retval -1/EAFNOSUPPORT  @p addr->sa_family does not match the socket family.
 * @retval -1/EACCES        The requested address is protected and the caller lacks permission.
 *
 * @note Thread safety:

 *   and the name of the option must be specified. To manipulate options at the socket level, `option_level` is specified as `SOL_SOCKET`. 
 *   To manipulate options at any other level, the protocol number of the appropriate protocol controlling the option is supplied. 
 *   For example, to indicate that an option is to be interpreted by the TCP protocol, `option_level` should be set to the protocol number of TCP.

 *   @ref SL_SO_VERIFY_DOMAIN_NAME) must be set before @ref connect().
 *
 * @post Post-conditions:

 *  
 * @param[in] option_value
 *   A pointer to the buffer containing the value for the option. Most socket-level options utilize an `int` argument for `option_value`.

 *   and the name of the option must be specified. To retrieve options at the socket level, `option_level` is specified as `SOL_SOCKET`. 
 *   To retrieve options at any other level, the protocol number of the appropriate protocol controlling the option is supplied. 
 *   For example, to indicate that an option is to be interpreted by the TCP protocol, `option_level` should be set to the protocol number of TCP. 
 *   The `option_value` and `option_length` arguments identify a buffer in which the value for the requested options are to be returned.
 *
 * @pre Pre-conditions:
