 * @brief
 *   Set a network credential including client credentials, certificates, and keys.
 * 
 * @details
 *   This function sets the network credential type and data for the specified credential ID.
 *   The credential data can include client credentials, certificates, and keys.
 * 
 *   Repeatedly calling this API with the same ID will overwrite the existing credential type and data.
 *  
 * @pre Pre-conditions:
 * - @ref sl_net_init should be called before this API.
 * 
 * @param[in] id
 *   Network credential identifier as identified by @ref sl_net_credential_id_t.
 * 
 * @param[in] type
 *   Network credential type as identified by @ref sl_net_credential_type_t.
 * 
 * @param[in] credential
 *   Pointer to the credential data object.
 * 
 * @param[in] credential_length
 *   Length of the credential data object.
 * 
 * @return
 *   sl_status_t. See [Status Codes](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/latest/platform-common/status) and [WiSeConnect Status Codes](../wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-err-codes/wiseconnect-status-codes) for details.
 *   If the credential is NULL or the credential length is zero, this API will return an error `SL_STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER`.
 *   If the credential_length exceeds NVM3_DEFAULT_MAX_OBJECT_SIZE when using NVM3 storage, this API will return an error `SL_STATUS_NVM3_WRITE_DATA_SIZE`.
 * @note
 * - Certificates should follow the standard array format.  
 * - After every 64 bytes, the special character `\n` should be used as a delimiter.
 * - The private key is prefixed with a header like "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----" line and postfixed with an footer like"-----END PRIVATE KEY-----". 
 * - Certificates are prefixed with a header like "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" line and postfixed with an footer like"-----END CERTIFICATE-----" line. 
 * - Text outside the prefix and postfix lines is ignored and can be used for metadata.
 * - The above mentioned Headers and Footers might vary 
 * - This API does not support the OPEN Security type for Wi-Fi client credentials.
 * - When configuring AP or client interfaces in open security mode, the credential ID must be set to `SL_NET_NO_CREDENTIAL_ID`.
