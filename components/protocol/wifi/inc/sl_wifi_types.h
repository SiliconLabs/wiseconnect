     *  - BIT[0] of Opportunistic Key Caching (OKC) is used to enable or disable OKC:
     *    - 0 – disable
     *    - 1 – enable
     *    When this is enabled, the module uses cached PMKID to get the Master Session Key (MSK), which is needed for generating PMK that is needed for the 4-way handshake.
     * - BIT[1] of OKC is used to enable or disable CA certification for PEAP connection:
     *   – 0 – CA certificate is not required
     *   – 1 – CA certificate is required
	   * - BIT[2-12] of OKC argument are used for cipher list selection for EAP connection. All possible ciphers are listed further:

	   * - BIT[13-31] of OKC argument is reserved.
	   * @note If a user sets BIT[1] and does not provide the CA certificate for PEAP connection, an error is thrown. If a user provides an invalid CA certificate, an error is also thrown. A user can set either one or multiple bits from BIT[2-12] to provide the cipher list. If a user does not provide any values in OKC BIT[2-12], all ciphers are selected by default.
