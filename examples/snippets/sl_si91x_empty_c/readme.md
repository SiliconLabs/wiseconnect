# Empty C Example

This example project provides a minimal starting point for developing applications on the Si91x device. It is designed to be a clean template where developers can build and test features incrementally.

The project demonstrates an empty configuration that includes the essential initialization along with default peripheral components such as:

- ADC
- BJT Temperature Sensor
- DMA
- ULP UART
