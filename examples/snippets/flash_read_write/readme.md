## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

The application uses the default configurations as provided in the **default_wifi_client_profile** in ``sl_net_default_values.h``. You can configure these parameters as needed.

## Configuration Parameters

In the application (`app.c`), you can configure the following parameters:

- **M4_FLASH_ADDRESS**: 
  - Represents the starting address in the common flash memory where the M4 region begins.
  - For the M4 region, the write address should start from 0x8000000.
  - It is used as the base address for writing data from the M4 core to the common flash memory.
- **NWP_FLASH_ADDRESS**:
  - Represents the starting address in the common flash memory where the NWP region begins.
  - For the NWP region, the write address should range from 0 to (20K-1).
  - It is used as the base address for writing data from the Network Processor (NWP) to the common flash memory.
- **LENGTH_OF_BUFFER**: Specifies the length of the buffer in bytes.
- **FLASH_SECTOR_ERASE_ENABLE**:
  - A flag used to enable or disable sector erase when writing data to flash.
  - When set to 1, it enables sector erase, allowing erasure of multiples of 4 KB of data.
  - When set to 0, it disables sector erase, allowing normal write operations onto flash without erasing sectors.

  >**Note**: Before performing a write operation, ensure that the flash memory is erased by setting `FLASH_SECTOR_ERASE_ENABLE` to `1`.

Modify these values in the `app.c` file as per the application requirements.

> **Note**: For recommended settings, see the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.
- After successful execution of the application, the following output is displayed on the console.
