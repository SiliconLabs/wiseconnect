## Purpose/Scope

The coex application demonstrates throughput measurement of Wi-Fi while BLE is in connection.

The coex application has WLAN and BLE tasks and acts as an interface between Smartphone and PC. Smartphone interacts with BLE task, while Both PC and Silicon Labs device would be connected to a Wireless Access Point, thus both are connected together wirelessly. When Smartphone connects to Silicon Labs device. And data transfer will happen between Station and AP.

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

Open `wifi_app_config.h` file

**Wi-Fi Configuration**

Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

```
#define SSID           "SILABS_AP"      // Wi-Fi Network Name
#define PSK            "1234567890"     // Wi-Fi Password
#define SECURITY_TYPE  SL_WIFI_WPA2     // Wi-Fi Security Type: SL_WIFI_OPEN / SL_WIFI_WPA / RSI_WPA2
```

**Client/Server IP Settings**

```c
#define DEVICE_PORT        <local_port>   // Local port to use
#define SERVER_PORT        <remote_port>  // Remote server port
#define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "192.168.0.100"     // Remote server IP address
#define BUF_SIZE 		   1400			  //! Memory length for send buffer
#define SOCKET_ASYNC_FEATURE 1                // Type of Socket used. Synchronous = 0, Asynchronous = 1
```

**Throughput Measurement Types**

The application may be configured to measure throughput using UDP, TCP, SSL packets. Choose the measurement type using the `THROUGHPUT_TYPE` macro.

```
#define THROUGHPUT_TYPE  TCP_TX     // Selects the throughput option; see the following diagrams. 
#define TCP_TX           0			// SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TCP client
#define TCP_RX           1			// SiWx91x receives packets from remote TCP server
#define UDP_TX           2			// SiWx91x transmits packets to remote UDP client
#define UDP_RX           3			// SiWx91x receives packets from remote UDP server
#define SSL_TX 			 4          // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote SSL client
#define SSL_RX           5          // SiWx91x receives packets from remote SSL server
```

To Load certificate to device flash.(Certificate could be loaded once and need not be loaded for every boot up)
   
```
#define  LOAD_CERTIFICATE                         0x01
```

#define RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID                         0x1BB1
```
RSI_BLE_MAX_DATA_LEN refers to the Maximum length of the attribute data.

```c
#define RSI_BLE_MAX_DATA_LEN                             20

```c
#define  RSI_BLE_APP_DEVICE_NAME                         "WLAN_BLE_APP"
```

The following are the **non-configurable** macros in the application.

RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_READ is used to set the READ property to an attribute value.

```
#define  RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_READ                       0x02
```

RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_WRITE is used to set the WRITE property to an attribute value.

```c
#define RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_WRITE                       0x08
```

RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_NOTIFY is used to set the NOTIFY property to an attribute value.

```c
#define  RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_NOTIFY                     0x10
```
