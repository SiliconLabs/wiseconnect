## Purpose/Scope

The coex application demonstrates throughput measurement of Wi-Fi while BLE is in connection.

The coex application has WLAN and BLE tasks and acts as an interface between a smartphone and a PC. A smartphone interacts with the BLE task, while both PC and Silicon Labs device would be connected to a Wireless Access Point, thus both are connected together wirelessly when a smartphone connects to Silicon Labs device. Data transfer will happen between the Station and AP.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

1. Open `wifi_app_config.h` file and edit the following parameters:


    - **Wi-Fi Configuration**

      Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

      ```c
      #define SSID           "SILABS_AP"      // Wi-Fi Network Name
      #define PSK            "1234567890"     // Wi-Fi Password
      #define SECURITY_TYPE  SL_WIFI_WPA2     // Wi-Fi Security Type: SL_WIFI_OPEN / SL_WIFI_WPA / RSI_WPA2
      ```

      > Note:
      > Users can configure default region-specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h`

    - **Client/Server IP Settings**

      ```c
      #define DEVICE_PORT        <local_port>   // Local port to use
      #define SERVER_PORT        <remote_port>  // Remote server port
      #define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "192.168.0.100"    // Remote server IP address
      #define BUF_SIZE           1400               //! Memory length for send buffer
      #define SOCKET_ASYNC_FEATURE 1                // Type of Socket used. Synchronous = 0, Asynchronous = 1
      ```

    - **Throughput Measurement Types**

      The application may be configured to measure throughput using UDP, TCP, TLS packets. Choose the measurement type using the `THROUGHPUT_TYPE` macro.

      ```c
      #define THROUGHPUT_TYPE  TCP_TX     // Selects the throughput option; see the following diagrams. 
      #define TCP_TX           0          // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TCP client
      #define TCP_RX           1          // SiWx91x receives packets from remote TCP server
      #define UDP_TX           2          // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote UDP client
      #define UDP_RX           3          // SiWx91x receives packets from remote UDP server
      #define TLS_TX           4          // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TLS client
      #define TLS_RX           5          // SiWx91x receives packets from remote TLS server
      ```

2. To Load certificate to device flash. (The Certificate could be loaded once and need not be loaded for every boot up.)

   ```c
   #define  LOAD_CERTIFICATE                         0x01
   ```

3. Open `ble_app.c` file and update/modify following macros:

   - `RSI_BLE_CHAR_SERV_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the characteristics to be added in a service.

      ```c
      #define  RSI_BLE_CHAR_SERV_UUID                         0x2803
      ```

   - `RSI_BLE_CLIENT_CHAR_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the client characteristics descriptor to be added in a service.

     ```c
     #define RSI_BLE_CLIENT_CHAR_UUID                        0x2902
     ```

   - `RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID` refers to the attribute value of the newly created service.

      ```c

      ```

   - `RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the first attribute under this service (RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID).

      ```c
      #define  RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID                        0x1AA1
      ```

   - `RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the second attribute under this service (RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID).

      ```c
      #define RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID                         0x1BB1
      ```

   - `RSI_BLE_MAX_DATA_LEN` refers to the Maximum length of the attribute data.

      ```c
      #define RSI_BLE_MAX_DATA_LEN                             20
      ```

   - `RSI_BLE_APP_DEVICE_NAME` refers to the name of the SiWx91x EVK to appear during scanning by remote devices.

      #define  RSI_BLE_APP_DEVICE_NAME                         "WLAN_BLE_APP"
      ```

   The following are the **non-configurable** macros in the application.

   - `RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_READ` is used to set the READ property to an attribute value.

      ```c
      #define  RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_READ                       0x02
      ```

   - `RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_WRITE` is used to set the WRITE property to an attribute value.

      ```c
      #define RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_WRITE                       0x08
      ```

   - `RSI_BLE_ATT_PROPERTY_NOTIFY` is used to set the NOTIFY property to an attribute value.

      ```c
