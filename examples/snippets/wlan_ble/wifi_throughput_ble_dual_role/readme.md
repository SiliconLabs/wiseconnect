## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

### WLAN Throughput

Open `wifi_app_config.h` file and configure below macros.

This section explains how to configure the application to measure TCP/UDP/SSL unidirectional throughput in alone or with combination of BT/BLE activities.

Set below macros to 1 to measure **WLAN** alone throughput

```c
#define RSI_ENABLE_WLAN_TEST    1 //Set this to 0 to disable WLAN
#define WLAN_THROUGHPUT_TEST    1 //Set this to 0 while measuring BLE throughput
```

Set below macros to 1 to measure **WLAN** throughput along with specific **BLE** activity.

```c
#define RSI_ENABLE_WLAN_TEST    1 //Set this to 0 to disable WLAN
#define WLAN_THROUGHPUT_TEST    1 //Set this to 0 while measuring BLE throughput
#define RSI_ENABLE_BLE_TEST     1 //Set this to 0 to disable BLE
```

> **Note:**
>
> While measuring WLAN throughput along with BLE activities, ensure 'BLE_THROUGHPUT_TEST' is set to '0'

Set below macros to 1 to measure **WLAN** throughput along with specific **BT** activity.

```c
#define RSI_ENABLE_WLAN_TEST    1 //Set this to 0 to disable WLAN
#define WLAN_THROUGHPUT_TEST    1 //Set this to 0 while measuring BLE throughput
#define RSI_ENABLE_BT_TEST      1 //Set this to 0 to disable BT
```

Set below macros to 1 to measure **WLAN** throughput along with **BT and BLE** activities.

```c
#define RSI_ENABLE_WLAN_TEST    1 //Set this to 0 to disable WLAN
#define WLAN_THROUGHPUT_TEST    1 //Set this to 0 while measuring BLE throughput
#define RSI_ENABLE_BLE_TEST     1 //Set this to 0 to disable BLE
#define RSI_ENABLE_BT_TEST      1 //Set this to 0 to disable BT
```
> **Note:**
>
> While measuring WLAN throughput with BLE activities ensure 'BLE_THROUGHPUT_TEST' is set to '0'

If BLE is enabled, configure specific activity of BLE using below macros.

- **BLE operations**: Set any one of below macros to choose desired BLE activity

```c
#define BLE_INIT_DONE                       0           //! make it 1 for BLE init only
#define BLE_CONNECTED                       0           //! make it 1 for BLE connection only
#define BLE_DATA_TRANSFER_START             1           //! make it 1 for BLE data transfer
```

By default, BLE_DATA_TRANSFER_START is set to '1', that means WLAN measurement will start after BLE GATT data transfers choose the required **operational mode** of SiWx91x module.

Valid Configurations are:

- 0  - WLAN alone mode
- 13 - WLAN + BLE mode

> **Note:**
>
> By default, opermode is set to WLAN+BLE

Select WLAN configurations in `wifi_app_config.h` file

Enter the AP Connectivity essentials configs as the value to SSID, SECURITY_TYPE and PSK

```c
#define     SSID                       "SILABS_AP"
#define     SECURITY_TYPE              RSI_WPA2
#define     PSK                        "12345678"
```

Channel no in which device should scan choose

```c
#define     CHANNEL_NO                 0       //! 0 - scan all channels
```

Port number of remote server

```c
#define     SERVER_PORT                5001
```

While verifying SSL RX throughput, port number of remote server should be configured below

```c
#define     SSL_SERVER_PORT         5002
```

IP address of remote server

```c
#define     SERVER_IP_ADDRESS          "192.168.0.102"
```

Port number of module

```c
#define     DEVICE_PORT                5001
```

To select the ip, configure below macros

```c
#define     DHCP_MODE                  1           // 0 enable or disable
```

Choose the throughput type by configuring below macro

```c
#define     THROUGHPUT_TYPE            TCP_TX 
```

   Valid Configurations of THROUGHPUT_TYPE:

- UDP_TX → UDP transmit
- UDP_RX → UDP receive
- TCP_TX → TCP transmit
- TCP_RX → TCP receive
- SSL_TX → SSL transmit
- SSL_RX → SSL receive

Average time required to measure UDP_TX/TCP_TX throughput

```c
#define     THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME        60000    //60sec of throughput numbers average
```

Maximum no. of packets required to measure UDP_RX

```c
#define     MAX_TX_PKTS                10000
```

Configure below macro to choose throughput measurement type . This option is valid while measuring WLAN alone throughput

```c
#define     CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT      0
```

If **CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT** is set to '1', then application measures throughput for every interval of 'THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME' independent of throughput type. If **CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT** is set to '0', then throughput is calculated only once for interval of 'THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME' in case of UDP/TCP TX , for MAX_TX_PKTS in case of UDP RX/ SSL TX and for default interval provided by server in case of TCP RX/SSL RX.

> **Note:**
>
> 1. By default, 'CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT' is set to '0' 
> 2. If CONTINUOUS_THROUGHPUT is set to '1', then ensure that client/server should run with interval at least greater than THROUGHPUT_AVG_TIME

#define     RSI_BLE_ADV_INT_MAX         0x06a8 //! 1065ms
```

Configure below macros to set connection interval, connection latency and connection supervision timeout

```c
#define     CONN_INTERVAL_C1            1600    // connection interval:2s
#define     CONN_LATENCY_C1             0       // latency : 0
#define     CONN_SUPERVISION_TIMEOUT_C1 1600   
```

### Common Steps

### WLAN throughputs: UDP/TCP/SSL unidirectional

1. Compile the project and flash the binary onto STM32

2. To measure **WLAN throughput** , run the below iperf commands or ssl scripts

- To measure **UDP Tx** throughput, configure module as UDP client and open UDP server in remote port using below command

  ```sh
           iperf.exe -s -u -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1
  ```

  ex: iperf.exe -s -u -p 5001 -i 1

- To measure **UDP Rx** througput, configure module as UDP server and open UDP client in remote port using below command

  ```sh
           iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -u -p <DEVICE_PORT> -i 1 -b<Bandwidth> -t <duration in sec>
  ```
  
  ex: iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.1 -u -p 5001 -i 1 -b50M -t 100

- To measure **TCP Tx** throughput, configure module as TCP client and open TCP server in remote port using below command

  ```sh
           iperf.exe -s -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1
  ```
  
  ex: iperf.exe -s -p 5001 -i 1

- To measure **TCP Rx** througput, configure module as TCP server and open TCP client in remote port using below command

  ```sh
           iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -p <DEVICE_PORT> -i 1 -t <duration in sec>
  ```

  ex: iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.1 -p 5001 -i 1 -t 100

- To measure **SSL Tx** throughput, configure module in SSL client and follow below steps to run SSL server in windows

  - Copy SSL_Server_throughput_d.py from release/resources/scripts/ to release/resources/certificates/

  - Open command prompt in folder release/resources/certificates/ and run below command

  ```sh
           python SSL_Server_throughput_d.py
  ```

- To measure **SSL Rx** throughput, configure module in SSL client and follow below steps to run SSL server in windows

  - Copy SSL_tx_throughput.py from release/resources/scripts/ to release/resources/certificate

  - Change port no. from "5001" to the value configured in "SSL_RX_SERVER_PORT"

  - Open command prompt in folder release/resources/certificates/ and run below command

  ```sh
           python SSL_tx_throughput.py
   ```

3. After the program gets executed, Module scans for the configured Access point, connects to it.

4. Acquires the ip address and waits for ble activities to complete if configured.

6. Scan for BLE advertise name (RSI_BLE_APP_GATT_TEST) using nRF connect (Android app)/ BLE dongles and initiate ble connection if found.

7. For BLE data transfer, enable GATT notifications of Module on service characteristic RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID (0x1AA1) using nRF connect. 

8. If Gatt Notification are enabled, module continuously transmits notifications per connection interval of size 20/232 bytes.

11. Once above activities are completed, Module transmits/receives packets based on the configuration selected and measures the WLAN throughput

> **Note:**
> Verify that all connections are stable and throughput is as expected.
> **Note:**
> In this release, due to low SPI frequency in EFR, wlan throughput are less compared to STM. Work is in progress to support the high frequency.

### BLE throughput

1. Compile the project and flash the binary onto STM32

2. If WLAN is configured, run the below iperf command (Note: Ensure module is configured as TCP client)

   ```sh
     iperf.exe -s -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1
   ```

   ex: iperf.exe -s -p 5001 -i 1

3. After the program gets executed, Module scans for the configured Access point, connects to it and acquires the ip address

4. After acquiring ip address, connects to remote server and starts tcp download

5. After successful connection, transmit the data using same android app to module.

6. Module receives the data transmitted by app and retransmits the same to BT SPP manager app.

7. After completion of WLAN, scan for BLE advertise name (RSI_BLE_APP_GATT_TEST) using nRF connect (Android app)/ BLE dongles and initiate ble connection if found.

8. After successful connection, enable Gatt notifications of Module on service characteristic RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID (0x1AA1) using nRF connect.

9. If GATT NotificationS are enabled, module continuously transmits notifications per connection interval of size 232 bytes.

10. While transmitting, measure the throughput using BLE sniffer
