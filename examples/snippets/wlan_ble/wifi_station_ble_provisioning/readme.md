# WLAN Station BLE Provisioning

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This example demonstrates how to configure/connects SiWx91x to get the WiFi connection functionality using BLE provisioning.

SiWx91x starts advertising in BLE mode and Access Point details are fetched using BLE Provisioning.

SiWx91x is configured as a WiFi station and connects to an Access Point.
