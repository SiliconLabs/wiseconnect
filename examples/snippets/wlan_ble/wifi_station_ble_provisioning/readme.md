For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

> **Note:** `wlan_config.h`, `ble_config.h` files are already set with the above desired configuration for this example.

- Open `ble_app.c` file and update/modify following macros

    - `RSI_BLE_CHAR_SERV_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the characteristics to be added in a service.
    
        ``` c
        #define  RSI_BLE_CHAR_SERV_UUID                         0x2803
        ```

    - `RSI_BLE_CLIENT_CHAR_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the client characteristics descriptor to be added in a service.
    
        ```c
        #define RSI_BLE_CLIENT_CHAR_UUID                        0x2902
        ```

    - `RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID` refers to the attribute value of the newly created service.
    
        ```c
        #define  RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID                       0xAABB
        ```

    - `RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the first attribute under this service (RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID).
    
        ```c
        #define  RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID                        0x1AA1
        ```

    - `RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the second attribute under this service (RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID).
    
        ```c
        #define RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID                         0x1BB1
        ```

    - `RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_3_UUID` refers to the attribute type of the third attribute under this service (RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID).

###  Steps to verify the WLAN Station BLE Provisioning Example

 Steps to be followed to verify WLAN Station BLE Provisioning with Android **Simplicity Connect App(formerly EFR Connect App)** App
 > **Note:** Version 2.9.0.

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK/WPA3 mode to connect the SiWx91x in STA mode.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. When SiWx91x EVK enters BLE advertising mode, launch the **Simplicity Connect App(formerly EFR Connect App)** App.

4. Click on Demo and select Wifi-Commissioning tile.

5. The Si917 advertises as the "BLE_CONFIGURATOR". Click on "BLE_CONFIGURATOR".

    ![](resources/readme/remote_screen6.png)

6. Once the BLE got the connected, list of available Access Points in the vicinity, get displayed on the screen.

7. Select the AP from the scanned list as shown below.

    ![](resources/readme/remote_screen3.png)

8. If the selected AP is configured in the security, the password entry pop-up window will be appeared.

9. Enter the password and click on "CONNECT".

10. Connect to an Access Point, once the SiWx91x EVK gets connected to AP, IP address of SiWx91x EVK get displayed on the screen.

11. To disconnect from Access Point, click on connected AP and click on YES
