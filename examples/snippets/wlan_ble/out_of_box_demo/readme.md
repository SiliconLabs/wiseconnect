## Purpose/Scope

The demo works with both the Wireless pro kit (WPK) and the SiWG917 dev kit. If the pro kit is used, the demo displays its status on the TFT-LCD display of the WPK baseboard. 
The SiWG917 dev kit does not have an onboard display. All device activities for the pro and dev kits can be observed on the serial terminal prints. 

SiWG917 establishes WLAN connectivity via BLE provisioning. SiWG917 then proceeds to ping [www.silabs.com](https://www.silabs.com) for 5 times, after which MQTT connectivity with a remote mosquitto broker [test.mosquitto.org](http://test.mosquitto.org) is established.
Then Network processor of SiWG917 enters connected sleep state.
If a message is published onto the topic from a MQTT client application [https://testclient-cloud.mqtt.cool/](https://testclient-cloud.mqtt.cool/) to which the module is subscribed (Si917_MQTT_RECEIVE), the NWP wakes up and displays the received data and goes back to sleep. If BTN0 on the WPK baseboard or dev kit board is pressed, SiWG917 publishes a message onto a MQTT topic named Si917_APP_STATUS. The status of application is updated on the TFT-LCD display on the WPK baseboard, the same can be observed on the serial terminal prints as well.

## Test the Application

### Application display

If the pro kit used, The status of the application is updated in TFT-LCD display of the WPK baseboard. 
The SiWG917 dev kit does not have an onboard display. All device activities for the pro and dev kits can be observed on the serial terminal prints.
To view the application prints on the console, refer [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#console-input-and-output).

### Run the application

- The SiWG917 dev kit comes pre-programmed with the SiWG917 demo v2.0. If the pro kit used, please check if the messages being displayed on the LCD display on WPK or the serial terminal prints do not indicate the application binary version (as shown in the following image):
  
    ![OOB initialization screen v1.0](resources/readme/status_lcd1_v1_0.png)

    > Note:
    > The Dev Kit (BRD2605A) and Explorer Kit (BRD2708A) do not support display functionality.

    It implies that an older version of OOB demo binary (older than v2.0) is running on the SiWG917 board. 
    
    It is recommended to upgrade to the latest OOB demo binary (With the application binaries older than v2.0, there's a possibility of observing issues with MQTT data transfer, as the test MQTT server limits multiple devices with same CLIENT ID from connecting at the same time. This has been fixed in the application binary v2.0).

    To upgrade to latest application binary, refer [upgrade application binary](#upgrade-application-binary) section.

    Also, upgrade the connectivity firmware (NWP firmware) to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues with application binary. Download the latest connectivity firmware from [Wiseconnect github repository](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/tree/master/connectivity_firmware) and refer [Upgrade SiWx91x Connectivity Firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#upgrade-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)  to upgrade the connectivity firmware.

    If the messages being displayed on the LCD display on WPK or the serial terminal prints indicate versioning information (Si917 OOB Demo v2.0 - as show in the following image)

    ![OOB initialization screen v2.0](resources/readme/status_lcd1_v2_0.png)

    It implies that OOB demo binary v2.0 (latest application binary) is running on the SiWG917 board. Proceed to the next steps of the demo.

- Once the application is flashed or the SiWG917 board is powered up, the Wireless interface is initialized.
- After the Wireless initialization, the module starts BLE advertising and advertises itself as "BLE_CONFIGURATOR"
- The status of the application can be observed on the TFT-LCD display on the WPK baseboard or the serial terminal prints.

- NWP (network processor of SiWG917) enters connected sleep.  

- To connect to a working MQTT broker and update the mqtt_hostname in the `wifi_app.c` file, follow these steps:

### Update MQTT Hostname in wifi_app.c

- By default, the mqtt_hostname in the `wifi_app.c` file is set to "test.mosquitto.org".
  
  ```c
  char *mqtt_hostname = "test.mosquitto.org";     
  ```

- If you are using a different MQTT broker, replace "test.mosquitto.org" with the appropriate hostname.

- To check if the MQTT broker is working, you can use the online MQTT client available at the below link.

  >**NOTE :**
  >
  > If the default MQTT broker link is not working, you can try using other MQTT brokers listed on the webpage. For example, if "test.mosquitto.org" is not functioning, you can use "broker.mqtt.cool" as an alternative. Follow the steps mentioned above to update the MQTT hostname.

- Go to the browser and open the [online mqtt client](https://testclient-cloud.mqtt.cool/).

  ![MQTT test client image-1](resources/readme/MQTT_testclient1.png)
