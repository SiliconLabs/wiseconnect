## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

- The WLAN_TASK_ENABLE macro is a configuration option that controls whether the WLAN (Wi-Fi) task is enabled in the application.
- When WLAN_TASK_ENABLE is set to 1, the application will start and run the WLAN task, allowing the device to scan for Wi-Fi networks, connect to an access point, and perform Wi-Fi-related operations.
- If it is set to 0, the WLAN task will be disabled, and Wi-Fi functionality will not be configured in the application.

**Configure the WLAN parameters**

    ```c
    #define WLAN_TASK_ENABLE 1
    ```

2. In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **wifi** folder and open the `wifi_app_config.h` file and update/modify following macros:

   - Enter the AP Connectivity essentials configurations as the value to SSID, SECURITY_TYPE, CHANNEL_NO and PSK

      ```c
      #define SSID          "YOUR_AP_SSID"
      #define SECURITY_TYPE SL_WIFI_WPA2
      #define CHANNEL_NO    0
      #define PSK           "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE"
      ```

   - Choose the throughput type by configuring below macro:

      ```c
      #define     THROUGHPUT_TYPE            TCP_TX
      ```

      - Valid Configurations of THROUGHPUT_TYPE:

        - UDP_TX → UDP transmit
        - UDP_RX → UDP receive
        - TCP_TX → TCP transmit
        - TCP_RX → TCP receive
        - SSL_TX → SSL transmit
        - SSL_RX → SSL receive

   - IP address of remote server:

      ```c
      #define     SERVER_IP          "192.168.0.234"
      ```

   - Port number of module:

      ```c
      #define     DEVICE_PORT                5005
      ```

   - Port number of remote server

      ```c
      #define     SERVER_PORT                5000
      ```

   - To select the ip, configure below macros:

      ```c
      #define     DHCP_MODE                  1
      ```

   - Enable the following macro only if the user wants to ensure that the Wi-Fi thread continuously scans for APs and prints the scan results:

      ```c
      #define WIFI_CONTINUOUS_SCAN_MODE_ONLY 0
      ```

   - Enable this macro only if the user wants to connect WiFi to the AP, print the IP address, and then suspend the connection

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:

1. Set all the configurations necessary as described in sections "Configure the BLE parameters" and "Configure the WLAN parameters".

   **Note:** According to the application flow, both WLAN and BLE tasks are running in separate threads. Depending on the user's choice, either the WLAN connection will establish first or the BLE connection will establish first.

2. By default, the Si91x device is configured for two extended advertising sets and extended scanning. Its advertising can be validated with any remote device that supports the AE feature. The following image shows the Si91x device's extended advertising sets as seen in the SiConnect app.

     ![](resources/readme/remote_scanner.png)

### Central Connection

1. To make remote central connection, scan from any BLE scanner application (SiConnect app) search for the device (if no random address is set it will advertise with the public address).
2. Default application advertises with a random address for BLE_AE_ADV_HNDL_SET_1 and with a public address for BLE_AE_ADV_HNDL_SET_2.
3. As shown in step 2, to establish the connection, click on the **CONNECT** option of the device for the required advertising set.
4. AFter the physical level connection is established, and if SMP is enabled, the application will initiate the SMP process, as shown in the images below.

### Pairing Procedure

1. A pairing request pop-up will appear as shown in the image below. Click on the **Pair and connect** option.

     ![](resources/readme/pairing_prompt_on_conn.png)

2. A subsequent pairing pop-up will appear as shown in the image below. Click on the **Pair** option.

     ![](resources/readme/pairing_prompt.png)

3. The passkey will be displayed in the serial terminal.

     ![](resources/readme/passkey_display_term_log.png)

4. Enter the passkey as shown in the following image and click on the "OK" option to proceed.

     ![](resources/readme/passkey_entry.png)

5. Once the SMP pairing process is successful, the connection status is displayed as follows:

     ![](resources/readme/active_connection.png)

### Peripheral Connection

   1. If extended scanning is enabled, the Si91x device will scan for the advertising devices using the configured scan parameters.

   2. To make a remote peripheral connection, advertise the remote device with the specific name defined in the RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME1 macro.

      **Note:**  See [Create a New Advertisement Set](https://docs.silabs.com/mobile-apps/latest/mobile-apps-explore/03-ble-configure-view) for creating the advertising set in the Simplicity Connect mobile App (formerly EFR Connect App).

   3. Add required services (for example, heartrate service) as shown in the following below and advertise from the remote peripheral device.

       ![](resources/readme/add_heartrate_gatt_service.png)

   4. If SMP is enabled for this connection, the bonding process is initiated after connection is established as mentioned in Pairing procedure.

### BLE Data Transfer

   1. Click on the **Notify** property to enable notifications for continuous data transfer from the Si91x device.
    When notifications are enabled, the **Notify** option will be highlighted as shown in the following image.

       ![](resources/readme/notification_enable.png)

**To Set Up the WLAN Connection**

   1. If `WLAN_TASK_ENABLE` is set to 1, the device initializes the Wi-Fi module using the configuration parameters defined in the application (such as SSID and security type).
   2. It then scans for available Wi-Fi networks, connects to the designated access point, and performs Wi-Fi-related operations as specified in the application.

      ![Prints in docklight window](resources/readme/output_wlan_init.png)
      ![Prints in docklight window](resources/readme/output_wlan_scan_conn.png)

   3. To enable Wi-Fi TCP data transfer, the application has the TCP client functionality. The user needs to run the TCP server on the PC that is connected to the same AP.

      **Note:**  Refer to the commands mentioned in the section "WLAN throughputs: UDP/TCP/TLS unidirectional" point 3 to configure iperf as TCP server.

   4. On the Wi-Fi side, the SiWx91x device is configured as a UDP/TCP/TLS server or client. When the SiWx91x device is configured as a server, it transmits data to the iperf client. Similarly, when the SiWx91x device is configured as a client, it receives data from the iperf server for a specified interval of 30 seconds. After the transmission or reception is complete, the final average application throughput will be displayed in the serial console.
