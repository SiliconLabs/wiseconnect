## Purpose / Scope

The coex application demonstrates the procedure for configuring a device in WiSeConnect coex mode with WLAN standby and BLE connected power save.

In this coex application, Silicon Labs BLE device connects with remote BLE device (for example, Smart phone with Simplicity Connect App) and issues a connected power save command to the module. 
In parallel, the Silicon Labs WiFi interface connects with an Access Point in station mode and issues a connected power save command.

## Build and Test the Application

Follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

#### SoC Mode
### Tickless Mode

In Tickless Mode, the device enters sleep based on the idle time set by the scheduler. The device can be awakened by these methods: SysRTC, a wireless signal, Button press-based (GPIO), and Alarm-based wakeup.

- **SysRTC (System Real-Time Clock)**: By default, the device uses SysRTC as the wakeup source. The device will enter sleep mode and then wake up when the SysRTC matches the idle time set by the scheduler.

- **Wireless Wakeup**: The device can also be awakened by a wireless signal. If this signal is triggered before the idle time set by the scheduler, the device will wake up in response to it.

- **Button Based Wakeup**:The device can also be awakened by a button signal.

- **Alarm Based Wakeup**:The device can also be awakened by setting the timeout to the appropriate duration in the osSemaphoreAcquire function.

- Once the project is created, click on the build icon (hammer) to build the project (or) right click on project and click on Build Project.

### Steps to verify the WLAN Station BLE Power Save Example

#### Steps to be followed to verify WLAN Station BLE Provisioning with Android **Simplicity Connect App**

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect the SiWx91x in STA mode.

2. In Windows PC2 (Remote PC) which is connected to AP, run the Openssl server by entering the following command:

   ```sh
      > Openssl.exe s_server -accept<SERVER_PORT> â€“cert <server_certificate_file_path> -key <server_key_file_path> -tls<tls_version>

      Example:
      > openssl.exe s_server â€“accept 5001 â€“cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem â€“tls1_2
   ```

   ![](resources/readme/openssl_command.png)

3. Once the program runs, BLE starts advertising, and WLAN connects to the AP, establishing an SSL connection with the server running on Windows PC1.

   ![](resources/readme/wlan_connection1.png)

4. After WLAN obtains an IP address, the power save command is sent to the module.

   ![](resources/readme/power_save_log.png)

5. Open a Simplicity Connect App in the Smartphone and perform the scan.

6. The Siwx917 device advertises as the "WLAN_BLE_SIMPLE_CHAT" and can be configured using the "RSI_BLE_APP_DEVICE_NAME" macro and Initiate connection from the Simplicity Connect App.

   ![](resources/readme/ble_scan.png)

7. After a successful connection, the Simplicity Connect App displays the supported services of the Silicon Labs SiWx91x module.

8. Select the attribute service RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID (for example, 0xAABB) and enable notifications for the attribute UUID RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID (for example, 0x1BB1) to receive Wi-Fi STA data.

   ![](resources/readme/SI_Connect_notify1.png)

9. Send a message from the SSL server on Windows PC1 (for example, 'Hello from WLAN'). The SiWx91x module forwards this to the BLE device.

   ![](resources/readme/send_hello_from_ssl_log.png)

10. The user can observe the message notification on the attribute UUID RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID (for example, 0x1BB1) in the Simplicity Connect App.

    ![](resources/readme/SI_Connect_notify2.png)

    ![](resources/readme/SI_Connect_activity_log.png)

11. From the Simplicity Connect App, send a message (for example, 'Hello from BLE') using attribute UUID RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID (for example, 0x1AA1). The user can observe the message in the Openssl server.

    ![](resources/readme/SI_Connect_ble_message.png)

    ![](resources/readme/SSL_server_log.png)

12. Note the down power measurement by connecting the Module to the Energy Profiler.
