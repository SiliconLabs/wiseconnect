# WLAN Station BLE Provisioning with AWS cloud

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This example demonstrates how to configure/connects SiWx91x to get the WiFi connection functionality using BLE provisioning. In this application, SiWx91x starts advertising in BLE mode and Access Point details are fetched using BLE Provisioning.

The SiWx91x module is configured  as a station, which associates to an access point and then communicates with an AWS server using MQTT. Si917 connected to LM75 Temperature Sensor via I2C interface, collects real time temperature data publishes to the cloud until the device is disconnected from the access point.  

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

   status =
   rsi_wlan_set_certificate(RSI_SSL_CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY, aws_client_private_key, (sizeof(aws_client_private_key) - 1));
   ```

> NOTE :
> For AWS connectivity, StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate has the highest authority being at the top of the signing hierarchy.
>
> The StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is an expected/required certificate which usually comes pre-installed in the operating systems and it plays a key part in certificate chain verification when a device is performing TLS authentication with the IoT endpoint.
>
> On SiWx91x device, we do not maintain root CA trust repository due to memory constraints, so it is mandatory to load StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate for successful mutual authentication to AWS server.
>
> The certificate chain sent by AWS server is as below:
> id-at-commonName=Amazon,id-at-organizationalUnitName=Server CA 1B,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
> id-at-commonName=Amazon Root CA 1,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
> id-at-commonName=Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority ,id-at-organizationName=Starfield Technologies, Inc.,id-at-localityName=Scottsdale,id-at-  stateOrProvinceName=Arizona,id-at-countryName=US)
>
> On SiWx91x to authenticate the AWS server, firstly Root CA is validated (validate the Root CA received with the Root CA loaded on the device). Once the Root CA is validation is successful , other certificates sent from the AWS server are validated.
> SiWx91x don't authenticate to AWS server if intermediate CA certificates are loaded instead of StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate and would result in Handshake error.
> StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is at <https://certs.secureserver.net/repository/sf-class2-root.crt>

      ![](resources/readme/load_image2.png)

### 5.2 Execution of AWS IoT with BLE Provisioning

### 5.2.2 BLE Provisioning with Android Application

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect the SiWx91x in STA mode.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. When SiWx91x EVK enters BLE advertising mode, launch the **EFR Connect** App.

4. Click on Demo and select Wifi-Commissioning tile.

   ![](resources/readme/remote_screen1.png)

5. It will scan for the module, and it appears in the list. For example, Ã¢â‚¬Å“SILABS_BLE_ConfiguratorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the UI, select this.
  
6. Now, SiWx91x module will start as a station and scan for the access points (AP) nearby.

7. Once the list of AP scan results is displayed on the screen, you can select the SSID of the AP to which you want to connect.

   ![](resources/readme/remote_screen2.png)

8. Click on the SSID of the AP, enter Ã¢â‚¬Å“passwordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ if the AP is in security mode. Click on Ã¢â‚¬Å“ConnectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to associate with the access point.

   ![](resources/readme/remote_screen3.png)

9. Once Silicon labs module is connected to the access point, you can notice on the GUI as below.

   ![](resources/readme/remote_screen4.png)

10. This completes the BLE provisioning using Android application, next step is the MQTT communication.
   Refer *Section 5.2.3*

11. To disconnect from Access Point, click on connected AP and click on YES

![](resources/readme/remote_screen5.png)

### 5.2.3 MQTT Connection

1. Once MQTT connection completed , device subscribed to specific Topic and waits for data from the Cloud.
   if any data received through AWS cloud from subscribed clients, then module publishes temperature sensor reading to MQTT client in case of EFR32.

   ![](resources/readme/aws_screen.png)

2. You can use any MQTT client and connect to the AWS cloud, for subscribe and publishing messages.
