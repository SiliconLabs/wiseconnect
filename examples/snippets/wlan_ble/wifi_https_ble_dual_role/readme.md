## Purpose / Scope

This example demonstrates the ability of SiWx917 connecting and transferring the data simultaneously in BLE/WiFi wireless interfaces.

In the Coex mode (WiFi+BLE), the module will connect to AP and then download the fixed file from PC acting as Server and supports BLE connection/data transfers simultaneously.

The Application can be configured for the individual protocol execution as well the combination of protocols execution ( WiFi+BLE). Two BLE connections (Central and Peripheral) are supported.

- Build the application

  - SoC mode:  Build as  Https Ble Dual Role  Example

      ![Build as](resources/readme/htttp_dualrole_build.png)

  - NCP mode:

      ![Build as](resources/readme/htttp_dualrole_build.png)

## Test the application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

  - SoC

    ![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/htttp_dualrole_run.png)

  - NCP

    ![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/htttp_dualrole_run.png)

- Follow the steps for the successful execution of the program :

1. Before running below commands, make sure the file configured in 'DOWNLOAD_FILENAME' is present under below path

   [File path: `/<SDK>/resources/scripts/`]

2. To download the files from local http server, navigate to below folder and run below command.

   [File path: `/<SDK>/resources/scripts/`]

   python simple_http_server.py 80
     
    ![](resources/readme/http_server_1.png)

3. To download the files from local https server, copy ssl certificates 'server-cert.pem' , 'server-key.pem' from below 'source path' and paste in to 'destination path'.

   [source path: `/<SDK>/resources/certificates/`]

   [destination path: `/<SDK>/resources/scripts/`]

     Open command prompt, navigate to above destination path and run below command.

   openssl s_server -accept 443 -cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem -tls1_2 -WWW
     
    ![](resources/readme/SSL_screen1.png)
    **Note**: OpenSSL 1.1.1w 11 Sep 2023

4. After the program gets executed, module scan and connects to the configured Access point and acquires the ip address
  
    ![](resources/readme/output1.png)

5. After acquiring ip address, initiates connection to remote server.(ex: simple_http_server.py running in same network where Module is also connected)
  
    ![](resources/readme/output2.png)

6. If connection is successful,

   - SiWx917 starts advertising and scanning BLE

   - Advertises BLE and simultaneously downloads http packets sent from remote server

7. If connection is not successful, step 5 is repeated until connection is success

8. While downloading is happening, user can initiate  BLE connections (both peripheral and central).

9. To check BLE peripheral connection, scan and initiate connection from EFR connect/dongles.
  
    ![](resources/readme/remote_screen2.png)

10. SiWx917 accepts the BLE connections if initiated by remote BLE device(max 2 peripheral connections are accepted) and starts data transfer based on the user configuration.

11. To check data transfer, enable Gatt notifications of Module on service characteristic RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_1_UUID
  
    ![](resources/readme/remote_screen3.png)

12. If enabled SiWx917 continuously transmits 20 notifications per connection interval of size 20bytes.
  
    ![](resources/readme/remote_screen1.png)
      
    ![](resources/readme/output3.png)

13. To check BLE central connection, advertise the remote ble devices using phone/dongles.
  
    ![](resources/readme/output4.png)

14. Module scans for advertised devices, crosschecks the ble device names/ble device address as configured in application, if matches initiate connection.

    ![](resources/readme/remote_screen4.png)

15. If BLE connection is successful, Si91x enables the Gatt notifications of remote device for RSI_BLE_CLIENT_NOTIFICATIONS_CHAR_UUID_C1 (Heart Rate measurement) and receives notifications/connection interval.

    ![](resources/readme/output4_1.png)

   > **Note:** Steps 9 to 12 can be repeated for 2 peripheral connection and steps 13 to 15 can be repeated for 3 central connections based on the RSI_BLE_MAX_NBR_CENTRALS and RSI_BLE_MAX_NBR_PERIPHERALS. Verify that all connections are stable and simultaneous data transfer is happening from all the radios of SiWx917.
