## Application Build Environment

- The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes as needed.
- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config/** folder and open the ``sl_net_default_values.h`` file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

  - STA instance related parameters

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
      ```

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
      ```

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE              SL_WIFI_WPA2 
      ```

  - Configure the following parameters in ``app.c`` to test WebSocket Client app as per requirements

  - WebSocket Server IP and Port Settings

    ```c
    #define SERVER_IP_ADDR "192.168.29.186"
    #define HOST_NAME      "example.com"
    #define RESOURCE_NAME  "/myresource"
    ```

NOTE:
> Procedure to run the example
> 1. The application initializes the WebSocket client with the server IP, host name, and resource name.
>
> 2. The WebSocket client connects to the server.
>
> 3. The client sends data to the server and waits for a ping response.
>
> 4. Upon receiving a ping, the client sends a pong response and closes the connection.
>
> 5. The WebSocket client is deinitialized.

## Running the WebSocket Server

To run the WebSocket server, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. Navigate to the directory containing the `package.json` file located at: `<SDK>/resources/websocket_server`.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Update the `index.js` file to enable SSL if required by setting the `USE_SSL` variable to `true`:

   ```javascript
   const USE_SSL = true; // Set to true to use WSS (WebSocket Secure), false to use WS (WebSocket)
   ```

5. Start the WebSocket server by running:

   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

6. The server will start listening on port 8080. You should see the following message in your terminal: Server is listening on port 8080

7. The WebSocket server is now ready to accept connections from the WebSocket client application.

## Configuring the WebSocket Client for SSL

1. Update the `sl_websocket_config_t` structure in your client application to set the `enable_ssl` field to `true`:

   ```c
   sl_websocket_config_t ws_config = {
     .host                = HOST_NAME,
     .resource            = RESOURCE_NAME,
     .server_port         = 8080,
     .client_port         = 5001,
     .ip_address          = SERVER_IP_ADDR,
     .data_cb             = data_callback,
     .remote_terminate_cb = remote_terminate_callback,
     .enable_ssl          = true, // Enable SSL
   };
   ```

2. Load the SSL CA certificate in the `app.c` file as shown below.

   ```c
   #include "cacert.pem.h"
   
   // Load SSL CA certificate
   status = sl_net_set_credential(SL_NET_TLS_SERVER_CREDENTIAL_ID(CERTIFICATE_INDEX),
                                  SL_NET_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE,
                                  cacert,
                                  sizeof(cacert) - 1);
   if (status != SL_STATUS_OK) {
     printf("\r\nLoading TLS CA certificate into FLASH Failed, Error Code : 0x%lX\r\n", status);
     return;
   }
   printf("\r\nLoad SSL CA certificate at index %d Success\r\n", CERTIFICATE_INDEX);
   ```
