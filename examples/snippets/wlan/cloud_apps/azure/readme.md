## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the ``sl_net_default_values.h`` file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- STA instance related parameters

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.
	
	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
  	```

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  	```c 
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
  	```
  
	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.
  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE              SL_WIFI_WPA2 
  	```
  
- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

Open the ``demo_config.h`` file. Configure the following parameters.
- Refer to connection string from [Appendix](#appendix) 1.3.1 step 5 to define below macros:
  - IoTHub hostname.
  	```c
  	#define democonfigHOSTNAME              YOUR IOT HUB HOSTNAME HERE 
  	```

  - IoTHub device Id.
  	```c
  	#define democonfigDEVICE_ID              YOUR DEVICE ID HERE
  	```
  > **Note**
  - To Use Symmetric Key
    ```c
      #define USE_SYMMETRIC_KEY   1 
    ```
  - To Use x509 Key
    ```c
      #define USE_SYMMETRIC_KEY   0 
    ```
  > **Note** : By default Symmetric Key is set
  - Device symmetric key.
  	```c
  	#define democonfigDEVICE_SYMMETRIC_KEY              Symmetric key
  	```

  - Client's X509 Certificate.
  	```c
  	#define democonfigCLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PEM            YOUR DEVICE CERT HERE
  	```

  - Client's private key.
  	```c
  	#define democonfigCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM            YOUR DEVICE PRIVATE KEY HERE
  	```

- Loading the certificates

  - If SAS authentication is to be used, only the CA ceritificate has to be loaded into the SiWx91x module. The CA certificate is already provided in the SDK in the linear array format (`silabs_dgcert_ca.pem.h`) and no additional configurations are required regarding the certificates.

    ```c
    // Certificate includes
    #include "silabs_dgcert_ca.pem.h"
    ```

  - If X509 authentication is to be used, Three certificates (CA certificate, device certificate and the private key certificate) are required for the authentication process and three certificates have to be loaded into the SiWx91x module. The CA certificate is provided in the SDK, but the device certificate and the private key certificates have to be generated, converted to linear array format and loaded into the module. Refer to [Register IoT Deivice with X.509 Authenticated Device with IoT Hub](#132---register-iot-deivice-with-x509-authenticated-device-with-iot-hub) regarding the process of generating, converting the certificates to linear array format and loading into the module.

    ```c
    // Certificate includes
    #include "silabs_client_cert.pem.h"
    #include "silabs_client_key.pem.h"
    #include "silabs_dgcert_ca.pem.h"
    ```

### 1.3 - **Register the authentication method**

### 1.3.1 - ***Register IoT Device with symmetric key authentication in IoT Hub:***

  **Step 3:** In **Create a device,** provide a name for your new device and select authentication type as "Symmetric key" and Save. This action creates a device identity for your IoT hub.

  ![Create Device](resources/readme/azurecreatedevicea.png)

  **Step 4:** After the device is created, open the device from the list in the **IoT devices** pane. Select Device created  and copy the **Primary Connection String** for use later.

  ![Create Device](resources/readme/azurecreatedevicea2.png)

  ![Primary connection string](resources/readme/azurecopyconnstring.png)

  **Step 5:** For symmetric key authentication the primary connection string has to be referred.
 For example, consider below sample connection string
 HostName=example.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=example_Device_SymKey;SharedAccessKey=xxxxxx";
 then configure macros as below
 ```c
#define democonfigHOSTNAME "example.azure-devices.net"
#define democonfigDEVICE_ID "example_Device_SymKey"
#define democonfigDEVICE_SYMMETRIC_KEY "xxxxxx"
 ```
Device is now successfully registered to IoT Hub with Symmetric key authentication type.

### 1.3.2 - ***Register IoT Device with X.509 Authenticated Device with IoT Hub***

 For X.509 self-signed authentication, sometimes referred to as thumbprint authentication, you need to create certificates to place on your device. These certificates have a thumbprint in them that you share with IoT Hub for authentication.

 Follow the steps below or refer to the [Register a X.509 Device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-authenticate-downstream-device?view=iotedge-2021-11#x509-self-signed-authentication)

  **Step 1:** Generating X509 Self Signed certificates

  Generate the IoT device's x509 Certificate and the Private key certificate by using the below OpenSSL command from a Powershell window

  `Openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout azure_client_key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out azure_client_cert.pem`

  After executing the above command, user is prompted to enter details like Country Name, click enter for all the fields

 ![x509 certificate generation with OpenSSL](resources/readme/azureclientx509openssl.png)

  The following private key and device certificate files are generated

- `azure_client_key.pem`  is the private key file
- `azure_client_cert.pem` is the x509 device certificate file

 **Step 2:** Capture the x509 certificate's Fingerprint (either SHA1 or SHA256)

  command for SHA-1 : ```openssl x509 -in azure_client_cert.pem -fingerprint -noout```

  Command for SHA-256 : ```openssl x509 -in azure_client_cert.pem -fingerprint -noout -sha256```

  ![x509 fingerprint](resources/readme/azureclientx509fingerprint.png)

   Copy the fingerprint hexadecimal number with 40 length [considering SHA1 type] and remove the **':'** from the fingerprint and the end result should look as below:

  `E2927BCA4BEBB41DE54DCCDE3148AE6AD8D175C8`

  **Step 3:** Go to Azure Portal - IoTHub to create new device with authentication type as X.509 Self-signed

  Fill the Device ID field. Choose X.509 Self-Signed as Authentication type. Enter the copied finger prints into both Primary Thumprint and Secondary Thumbprint fields.
  Click Save.

  ![Create x509 Device](resources/readme/azurex509devicecreate.png)

  **Step 4:** Converting the certificates to linear array format
  
  Copy the generated certificate file (azure_client_cert.pem) and key file (azure_client_cert.pem) into the <SDK_path>/resources/certificates

  Copy the certificate_to_array.py script from <SDK_path>/resources/scripts to <SDK_path>/resources/certificates

  Execute the following python commands to convert the generated certificate and key files into linear array format

  ```sh
  python certificate_to_array.py azure_client_cert.pem

  python certificate_to_array.py azure_client_key.pem
  ```

  The files "azure_client_cert.pem.h" and "azure_client_key.pem.h" are over-written with the contents of the certificate and keyfiles which we have generated earlier.

  **Step 5:** For X.509 self-signed authentication, there is no connection string available. We can configure as below
  ```c
  #define democonfigHOSTNAME "example.azure-devices.net"
  #define democonfigDEVICE_ID "example_Device_x509_Key"
   ```
   Device is now successfully registered with the IoT Hub with X509 self signed authentication type.
