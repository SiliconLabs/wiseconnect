# AWS MQTT Example

## 1 Purpose/Scope

The application demonstrates how to configure SiWx91x as an IoT devices and securely connect to AWS IoT Core to subscribe and publish on a topic by using AWS MQTT library.

In this application, SiWx91x is configured as Wi-Fi station and connects to an Access Point which has internet access. After successful Wi-Fi connection, application connects to AWS Core and subscribes to a topic (SUBSCRIBE_TO_TOPIC). The application publishes a message on a topic (PUBLISH_ON_TOPIC),and keeps the M4 processor in sleep. The M4 wakes up once it receives the wireless message from cloud.

Additionally, the M4 also wakes up based on alarm and on button (GPIO) press if the respective macro is enabled.

## Overview of AWS SDK

AWS IoT Core is a cloud platform which connects devices across AWS cloud services. AWS IoT provides a interface which allows the devices to communicate securely and reliably in bi-directional ways to the AWS touch-points, even when the devices are offline.

The AWS IoT Device SDK allow applications to securely connect to the AWS IoT platform.

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

### 4.1 Configure the application

### 4.1.1 Below parameters in **app.c** can be configured

```c
#define SUBSCRIBE_TO_TOPIC        "aws_status"  //! Subscribe Topic to receive the message from cloud
#define PUBLISH_ON_TOPIC          "si91x_status" //! Publish Topic to send the status from application to cloud
#define MQTT_PUBLISH_QOS1_PAYLOAD "Hi from SiWx917"
#define MQTT_USERNAME             "username"
#define MQTT_PASSWORD             "password"

#define ALARM_TIMER_BASED_WAKEUP   1   //!Enable this macro for M4 to wake up based on alarm time period

#### 4.5.1 Setting up Security Certificates

- To authenticate and securely connect with AWS, your Wi-Fi device requires a unique x.509 security certificate and private key, as well as a CA certificate which is used to verify the AWS server. Security credentials need to be converted into a C-array rather than [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) provided by AWS; they also need to be added to your project.

- The WiSeConnect SDK provides a conversion script (written in Python 3) to make the conversion straightforward. The script is provided in the SDK 'resources' directory and is called [certificate_to_array.py](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/resources/certificates/).

- To convert the device certificate and private key to C arrays, open a system command prompt and use the script as indicated in the following examples.

```sh
$> python3 certificate_to_array.py <input filename> <output arrayname>

For example:
$> python3 certificate_to_array.py d8f3a44d3f.cert.pem    aws_client_certificate
$> python3 certificate_to_array.py d8f3a44d3f.private.key aws_client_private_key
```

- After running the script on the certificate and private key, two new files are created.

```sh
aws_client_certificate.pem.crt.h
aws_client_private_key.pem.key.h
```

- Before proceeding, copy both of the new files to the WiSeConnect directory: `<SDK>/resources/certificates`  
  Go ahead and overwrite any existing files with the same name in that directory, the originals are not needed.

- The Root CA certificate used by your Wi-Fi device to verify the AWS server is already included in the WiSeConnect SDK; no additional setup is required.
  For reference, Amazon uses [Starfield Technologies](https://www.starfieldtech.com/) to secure the AWS website, the WiSeConnect SDK includes the [Starfield CA Certificate](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/resources/certificates/aws_starfield_ca.pem.h).

> NOTE :
> For AWS connectivity, StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate has the highest authority being at the top of the signing hierarchy.
>
> The StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is an expected/required certificate which usually comes pre-installed in the operating systems and plays a key part in certificate chain verification when a device is performing TLS authentication with the IoT endpoint.
>
> On SiWx91x device, we do not maintain the root CA trust repository due to memory constraints, so it is mandatory to load Starfield Root CA Class 2 certificate for successful mutual authentication to the AWS server.
>
> The certificate chain sent by AWS server is as below:
> id-at-commonName=Amazon,id-at-organizationalUnitName=Server CA 1B,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
> id-at-commonName=Amazon Root CA 1,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
> id-at-commonName=Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority ,id-at-organizationName=Starfield Technologies, Inc.,id-at-localityName=Scottsdale,id-at- stateOrProvinceName=Arizona,id-at-countryName=US)
>
> On SiWx91x to authenticate the AWS server, firstly Root CA is validated (validate the Root CA received with the Root CA loaded on the device). Once the Root CA validation is successful, other certificates sent from the AWS server are validated.
> SiWx91x doesn't authenticate to AWS server if intermediate CA certificates are loaded instead of Starfield Root CA Class 2 certificate and would result in a Handshake error.
> StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is at <https://certs.secureserver.net/repository/sf-class2-root.crt>

#### 4.5.2 Create an AWS Thing

Create a thing in the AWS IoT registry to represent your IoT Device.

- In the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home), in the navigation pane, under Manage, choose All devices, and then choose Things.

![AWS console](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step1.png)

- If a **You don't have any things yet** dialog box is displayed, choose **Register a thing**. Otherwise, choose **Create**.
- Click on **Create things**.

![AWS thing](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step2.png)

- On the **Create things** page, choose **Create a single thing** and click next.

![AWS thing creation](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step3.png)

- On the **Specify thing properties** page, enter a name for your IoT thing (for example, **Test_IoT**), and choose **Unnamed shadow (classic)** in the Device Shadow section, then choose **Next**. You can't change the name of a thing after you create it. To change a thing's name, you must create a new thing, give it the new name, and then delete the old thing.

  ![Add Device 1](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step4.png)

- During **Configure device certificate** step, choose **Auto-generate a new certificate (recommended)** option and click next.

  ![Add Device 2](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step5.png)

- Choose the **Download** links to download the device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate. Root CA certificate is already present in SDK (aws_starfield_ca.pem.h), and can be directly used.
  > **Warning:** This is the only instance you can download your device certificate and private key. Make sure to save them safely.
