# AWS IoT MQTT Client Example

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure SiWx91x as an IoT device and securely connect to AWS IoT Cloud to subscribe and publish on a topic by using AWS MQTT library.

In this application, the SiWx91x, which is configured as a Wi-Fi client interface, gets connected to an Access Point which has internet access. After successful Wi-Fi connection, the application connects to AWS IoT Cloud and subscribes to **SUBSCRIBE_TO_TOPIC** topic. Subsequently, the application publishes **MQTT_PUBLISH_PAYLOAD** message on **PUBLISH_ON_TOPIC** topic. After publish, the NWP processor is set in to associated power save.  Next, the application works differently in NCP and SoC modes as defined below.

**Soc Mode**:
The M4 processor is set in sleep mode. The M4 processor can be woken in several ways as mentioned below:
1. ALARM timer-based - In this method, an ALARM timer is run that wakes the M4 processor up periodically every **ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME** time period.
2. Button press-based (GPIO) - In tis method, the M4 processor wakes up upon pressing a button (BTN0).
3. Incoming publish-based - When an incoming publish is to be received by the application, the M4 processor is woken up.

After M4 processor wakes up via any of the above processes, the application publishes **MQTT_PUBLISH_PAYLOAD** message on **PUBLISH_ON_TOPIC** topic.

**NCP Mode**:
A timer is run with a periodicity of **PUBLISH_PERIODICITY** milliseconds. The application publishes **MQTT_PUBLISH_PAYLOAD** message on **PUBLISH_ON_TOPIC** topic in the following cases:
1. Once in every **PUBLISH_PERIODICITY** time period.
2. When an incoming publish is received by the application.

*NOTE*: The bold texts are the macros defined in the application. You can find more details about them in the upcoming section (#section 4).

## Overview of AWS SDK

AWS IoT Core is a cloud platform which connects devices across AWS cloud services. AWS IoT provides a interface which allows the devices to communicate securely and reliably in bi-directional ways to the AWS touch-points, even when the devices are offline.

The AWS IoT Device SDK allow applications to securely connect to the AWS IoT platform.

### 4.4 Application Output

**SoC mode**:

![SoC Application prints](resources/readme/application_prints_soc.png)
- In this instance, the SiWx91x has established a secure connection with the AWS Cloud, subscribed to *aws_status* topic, and published a message "Hi from SiWx91x" on *siwx91x_status* topic.
- The NWP processor is then set into associated power save mode.
- Subsequently, the M4 processor is set in to power save.
- Later, the application performs publish through any of the three procedures described below:

  *case 1*: When an incoming publish is received
  - Suppose, the message "Hi from AWS Cloud!" has been published by a test MQTT Client on *aws_status* topic. Upon reception of incoming publish, the NWP processor triggers M4 processor to wake up. The application then reads the received data, triggers a publish on *siwx91x_status* topic, and sets M4 processor back to sleep.

  *case 2*: When **BTN0** is pressed on WPK
  - The button press triggers M4 processor to wake from sleep. The application then performs a publish on *siwx91x_status* topic, and sets M4 processor back to sleep.

  *case 3*: When ALARM-timer elapses
  - By default, the ALARM-timer periodicity is 30 seconds (**ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME**). During every iteration, the ALARM triggers M4 processor to wake from sleep. The application then performs a publish on *siwx91x_status* topic, and sets M4 processor back to sleep.

**NCP Mode**:

![NCP Application prints](resources/readme/application_prints_ncp.png)
- In this instance, the SiWx91x has established a secure connection with the AWS Cloud, subscribed to *aws_status* topic, and published a message "Hi from SiWx91x" on *siwx91x_status* topic.
- The NWP processor is then set into associated power save mode.

  *case 1*: When an incoming publish is received
  - Suppose, the message "Hi from AWS Cloud!" has been published by a test MQTT Client on *aws_status* topic. Upon reception of incoming publish, the NWP processor triggers M4 processor to wake up. The application then reads the received data, triggers a publish on *siwx91x_status* topic, and sets M4 processor back to sleep.

  *case 2*: When periodic publish timer elapses
  - By default, the periodicity of the publish timer is 30 seconds (**PUBLISH_PERIODICITY**). For every **PUBLISH_PERIODICITY**, the application performs a publish on *siwx91x_status* topic.

**Application notes**:
1. Currently, for SoC, the button-based and ALARM-based implementations work in power save enabled mode only.
2. Currently, only QoS0-based publishes are supported.

## 5 AWS IoT configuration

 **Thing Note**: By default we are giving ThingName: silicon_labs_thing, these related configuration we set default If you want your own Thing name you can follow the below procedure

#### 5.1 Create an AWS IoT Thing

Create a thing in the AWS IoT registry to represent your IoT Device.

- In the [AWS IoT console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iot/home), in the navigation pane, under Manage, choose All devices, and then choose Things.

  ![AWS console](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step1.png)

- If a **You don't have any things yet** dialog box is displayed, choose **Register a thing**. Otherwise, choose **Create**.
- Click on **Create things**.

  ![AWS thing](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step2.png)

- On the **Create things** page, choose **Create a single thing** and click next.

  ![AWS thing creation](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step3.png)

- On the **Specify thing properties** page, enter a name for your IoT thing (for example, **Test_IoT**), and choose **Unnamed shadow (classic)** in the Device Shadow section, then choose **Next**. You can't change the name of a thing after you create it. To change a thing's name, you must create a new thing, give it the new name, and then delete the old thing.

  ![Add Device 1](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step4.png)

- During **Configure device certificate** step, choose **Auto-generate a new certificate (recommended)** option and click next.

  ![Add Device 2](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_step5.png)

- Choose the **Download** links to download the device certificate, private key, and root CA certificate. Root CA certificate is already present in SDK (aws_starfield_ca.pem.h), and can be directly used.
  > **Warning:** This is the only instance you can download your device certificate and private key. Make sure to save them safely.

  ![Downloading certificates](resources/readme/aws_thing_certificates_download.png)

- To attach an existing policy choose the policy and click on create thing, if policy is not yet created Choose Create policy and fill the fields as mentioned in the following images.

- choosing an existing policy

  ![Attach policy](resources/readme/aws_choosing_policy.png)

- creating a policy - step 1

  ![Create policy](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_attach_policy.png)

- creating a policy - step 2 (filling the fields)
  Give the **Name** to your Policy, Fill **Action** and **Resource ARN** as shown in below image, Click on **Allow** under **Effect** and click **Create**.
  ![Filling fields for policy](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_policy_create.png)

- choose the created policy and click on **Create thing**.

- The created thing should now be visible on the AWS console (Manage > All devices > Things).

#### 5.2 Steps to create a policy from AWS console

- Navigate to **AWS IoT console**.
- Choose **Policies** under **Secure**.

  ![AWS console create policy](resources/readme/aws_policy.png)

- Click on **Create**.

  ![Create policy](resources/readme/aws_create_policy.png)

- Give the **Name** to your Policy, Fill **Action** and **Resource ARN** as shown in below image, Click on **Allow** under **Effect** and click **Create**.

  ![Register Thing](resources/readme/aws_create_thing_policy_create.png)

#### 5.3 Setting up Security Certificates

- To authenticate and securely connect with AWS, your Wi-Fi device requires a unique x.509 security certificate and private key, as well as a CA certificate which is used to verify the AWS server. Security credentials need to be converted into a C-array rather than [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail) provided by AWS; they also need to be added to your project.

- The WiSeConnect SDK provides a conversion script (written in Python 3) to make the conversion straightforward. The script is provided in the SDK 'resources' directory and is called [certificate_to_array.py](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/resources/certificates/).

- To convert the device certificate and private key to C arrays, open a system command prompt and use the script as indicated in the following examples.

```sh
$> python3 certificate_to_array.py <input filename> <output arrayname>

For example:
$> python3 certificate_to_array.py d8f3a44d3f.cert.pem    aws_client_certificate
$> python3 certificate_to_array.py d8f3a44d3f.private.key aws_client_private_key
```

- After running the script on the certificate and private key, two new files are created.

```sh
aws_client_certificate.pem.crt.h
aws_client_private_key.pem.key.h
```

- Before proceeding, copy both of the new files to the WiSeConnect directory: `<SDK>/resources/certificates`  
  Go ahead and overwrite any existing files with the same name in that directory, the originals are not needed.

- The Root CA certificate used by your Wi-Fi device to verify the AWS server is already included in the WiSeConnect SDK; no additional setup is required.
  For reference, Amazon uses [Starfield Technologies](https://www.starfieldtech.com/) to secure the AWS website, the WiSeConnect SDK includes the [Starfield CA Certificate](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/resources/certificates/aws_starfield_ca.pem.h).

> NOTE :
> For AWS connectivity, StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate has the highest authority being at the top of the signing hierarchy.
>
> The StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is an expected/required certificate which usually comes pre-installed in the operating systems and plays a key part in certificate chain verification when a device is performing TLS authentication with the IoT endpoint.
>
> On SiWx91x device, we do not maintain the root CA trust repository due to memory constraints, so it is mandatory to load Starfield Root CA Class 2 certificate for successful mutual authentication to the AWS server.
>
> The certificate chain sent by AWS server is as below:
> id-at-commonName=Amazon,id-at-organizationalUnitName=Server CA 1B,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
> id-at-commonName=Amazon Root CA 1,id-at-organizationName=Amazon,id-at-countryName=US
> id-at-commonName=Starfield Services Root Certificate Authority ,id-at-organizationName=Starfield Technologies, Inc.,id-at-localityName=Scottsdale,id-at- stateOrProvinceName=Arizona,id-at-countryName=US)
>
> On SiWx91x to authenticate the AWS server, firstly Root CA is validated (validate the Root CA received with the Root CA loaded on the device). Once the Root CA validation is successful, other certificates sent from the AWS server are validated.
> SiWx91x doesn't authenticate to AWS server if intermediate CA certificates are loaded instead of Starfield Root CA Class 2 certificate and would result in a Handshake error.
> StarField Root CA Class 2 certificate is at <https://certs.secureserver.net/repository/sf-class2-root.crt>
