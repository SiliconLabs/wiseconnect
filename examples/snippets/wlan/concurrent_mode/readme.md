## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure the SiWx91x in concurrent mode i.e., in both Wi-Fi Station mode (STA instance) and Access Point mode (SoftAP instance).
In this example application, the SiWx91x's STA instance gets connected to a wireless Access Point and gets an IP address.

**NOTE**:

- The Host MCU platform (EFR32MG21) and the SiWx91x interact with each other through the SPI interface.

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.
- In the Project explorer pane, open the **app.c** file. Configure the following parameters based on your requirements

- STA instance related parameters

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name to which the Si91x module gets connected to.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"
  	```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL            "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE"
  	```
  	
  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE              SL_WIFI_WPA2 
  	```
- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

- AP instance related parameters

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID refers to the SSID of the WiSeConnect softAP that would be created.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID                   "MY_AP_SSID"
  	```

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key of the WiSeConnect softAP that would be created.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL                     "MY_AP_PASSPHRASE"
    ```

> Note:
>
> 1. In concurrent mode, STA and AP should be configured on the same channel. The STA instance shall first scan for the specified external AP, wherein the channel number of AP is fetched and passed as an argument during SoftAP creation.
> 2. Valid values for CHANNEL_NO are 1 to 11 in 2.4GHz band and 36 to 48 & 149 to 165 in 5GHz. In this example, default configured band is 2.4GHz.

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_ap_profile` configuration structure.

> Note:
>
> 1. This application is not providing the facility to configure the Access Pointâ€™s IP Parameters. Default IP address of the Silicon Labs Access point is **192.168.100.76**
> 2. In concurrent mode, the IP networks of Silicon Labs STA and Silicon Labs Access Point both should be different. Configure Wireless Access Point IP network(Ex: 192.168.0.1) other than Silicon Labs Access point IP network.

#### Open **sl_wifi_device.h** file. User can also refer the `sl_wifi_default_concurrent_configuration` and can modify/create configurations as per their needs and requirements
>
> Note:
>
> - In `sl_wifi_default_concurrent_configuration`, `oper_mode` must be `SL_SI91X_CONCURRENT_MODE` for this example.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
>
> Note: 
> - The default SSID is "MY_AP_SSID" and passphrase is "MY_AP_PASSPHRASE". You may either use these or modify them as described in the [Application Build Environment](#application-build-environment) section.
- Flash, run and debug the application.
