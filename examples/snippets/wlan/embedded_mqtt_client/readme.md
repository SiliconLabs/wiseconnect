## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how SiWx91x is configured as an MQTT client, connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to a topic, and publishes messages on a particular MQTT topic.
In this application, SiWx91x is configured as a Wi-Fi station and connects to an access point. After successful Wi-Fi connection, the application connects to a MQTT broker and subscribes to the topic called **THERMOSTAT-DATA**. Subsequently, the application publishes a message **"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do"** on the **WiFiSDK_TOPIC** topic. Finally, the application waits to receive the data published on the subscribed topic by other clients after which it unsubscribes from the topic it has subscribed to and disconnects from MQTT broker.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.

- SoC mode

   ![Application prints](resources/readme/application_prints_soc.png)

- NCP mode

   ![Application prints](resources/readme/application_prints_ncp.png)

Follow the steps below for successful execution of the application:

- Once the SiWx91x gets connected to the MQTT broker, it will subscribe to the topic **TOPIC_TO_BE_SUBSCRIBED (Ex: "THERMOSTAT-DATA")**. You can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.

   **![Client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/connect_subscribe.png)**

- SiWx91x publishes a message which is given in **PUBLISH_MESSAGE**. 
  (Ex: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do") on **PUBLISH_TOPIC** (Ex: WiFiSDK_TOPIC).

- MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the SiWx91x EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.

   **![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the SiWx91x EVK](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under **Publish** tab, select **raw** data format, type the data that you wish to send, and then click on **publish**. This message will be received by the SiWx91x.

    **![To publish a message using MQTT Explorer](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- In the MQTT broker and on the terminal, you can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed to that topic.

   **![In MQTT broker, user can observe the published message](resources/readme/publish_msg.png)**

- SiWx91x unsubscribes to the topic that it has subscribed to after receiving the message that was published by MQTT Explorer running on Windows PC2.

- Once subscription is successful, SiWx91x disconnects from the broker.

### Procedure for executing the application when enabled with SSL

1. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC1 which is connected to the access point through LAN.

2. Update the **mosquitto.conf** file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

3. Also, add **certs** folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

4. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port should be 8883)

   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
   **![Run MQTTS server](resources/readme/mqtts_server.png)**

5. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version **tlsv1**, just comment the **tls_version tlsv1** in **mosquitto.conf** file.

>**Note:**
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to the broker, add the following lines in **mosquitto.conf** file:

  ```c
  listener 8886
  allow_anonymous true
  ```

> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  `mosquitto -v -p 8886 -c config/mosquitto.conf`
  where **config** is the sub-folder and **mosquitto.conf** is the different config file than default.

## Additional Information

### Steps to set up MQTT server

1. To run MQTT broker on port 8886 in Windows PC1, open the command prompt and go to the MQTT installed folder (Ex: C:\Program Files\mosquitto) and run the following command:

   ```c
   mosquitto.exe –p 8886 –v
   ```

   **![Run MQTT broker in Windows PC1](resources/readme/mqtt_server.png)**

2. Open MQTT Explorer in Windows PC2 and delete the existing connections, if any, and click on **Advanced** as shown in the image below.

   **![Delete the existing connections](resources/readme/delete_connections.png)**

3. Delete the existing topic names if any. Enter the desired **TOPIC_NAME** in the topic field and click on **ADD**. The desired topic name then can be observed in the topic list. Click on **BACK** as shown in the image below.

   **![Add TOPIC NAME in topic field](resources/readme/add_topic_name.png)**

4. Connect to MQTT broker by entering IP address and port number of Windows PC1 in HOST and PORT fields in MQTT Explorer respectively, and click on **CONNECT**. If you are running your MQTT broker on the same PC, then the following configuration is made as shown in the image below.

   **![MQTT broker Configuration](resources/readme/connect.png)**

>**Note:**
> If we want to use IPv6 with the embedded MQTT client application, we will be using the Mosquitto command line to test the example because the MQTT Explorer application doesn't support IPv6.

> The following commands are used to test the MQTT client with IPv6 addresses using the Mosquitto command line:
>
> 1. `mosquitto_sub -h 2405:201:c013:61e3:faf7:fb6f:8d37:bca8 -p 1883 -t test/topic`
>
>    This command runs the Mosquitto client in subscriber mode.  It will connect to the MQTT broker and listen for messages published to a specific topic.
>
>    - `-h 2405:201:c013:61e3:faf7:fb6f:8d37:bca8`: Specifies the hostname or IP address of the MQTT broker to connect to. In this case, it's an IPv6 address.
>    - `-p 1883`: Specifies the network port that the MQTT broker is listening on. The default MQTT port is 1883.
>    - `-t test/topic`: Specifies the topic that the client should subscribe to. The client will receive any messages published to this topic.
>
> 2. `mosquitto_pub -h 2401:4901:1290:10de::1000 -p 1883 -t THERMOSTAT-DATA -m "hello"`
>
>    This command runs the Mosquitto client in publisher mode. It connects to the MQTT broker, publishes a message to a specific topic, and then automatically disconnects and closes the client.
>
>    - `-h 2401:4901:1290:10de::1000`: Like the `-h` option for `mosquitto_sub`, this specifies the hostname or IP address of the MQTT broker to connect to.
>    - `-p 1883`: This is the same as the `-p` option for `mosquitto_sub`, specifying the network port of the MQTT broker.
>    - `-t THERMOSTAT-DATA`: Specifies the topic that the client should publish the message to.
>    - `-m "hello"`: Specifies the message to publish. In this case, the message is the string "hello".
