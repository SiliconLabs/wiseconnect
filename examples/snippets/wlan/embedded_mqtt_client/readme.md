# Embedded MQTT

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how SiWx91x is configured as an MQTT client, connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to a topic and publishes messages on a particular MQTT topic.
In this application, SiWx91x is configured as a Wi-Fi station and connects to an Access Point. After successful Wi-Fi connection, application connects to a MQTT broker and subscribes to the topic called **THERMOSTAT-DATA**. Subsequently, the application publishes a message **"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do** on the **WiFiSDK_TOPIC** topic. Finally, the application waits to receive the data published on the subscribed topic by other clients after which it would be unsubscribe from topic it has subscribed to and disconnect from MQTT broker.

### 4.2 Build the application

- SoC mode:  Build as embedded mqtt Example

    **![Build as](resources/readme/embedded_mqtt.png)**

- NCP mode:

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

  - SoC

    ![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/program_device.png)

  - NCP

    ![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/program_device.png)

- Once the SiWx91x gets connected to the MQTT broker, it will subscribe to the topic **TOPIC_TO_BE_SUBSCRIBED (Ex: "THERMOSTAT-DATA")**. The user can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.

   **![Client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/connect_subscribe.png)**

- SiWx91x publishes a message which is given in **PUBLISH_MESSAGE**
  (Ex: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do") on **PUBLISH_TOPIC(Ex: WiFiSDK_TOPIC)**

- MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the SiWx91x EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.

   **![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the SiWx91x EVK](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under **Publish** tab, select **raw** data format, type the data that user wishes to send and then click on **publish**. This message will be received by the SiWx91x.

    **![To publish a message using MQTT Explorer](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- In the MQTT broker and on the terminal, user can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed to that topic.

   **![In MQTT broker, user can observe the published message](resources/readme/publish_msg.png)**

- SiWx91x unsubscribes to the topic that it has subscribe after receiving the message that was published by MQTT Explorer running on Windows PC2.

- Once subscription is successful, SiWx91x disconnects from the broker.

**Procedure for executing the application when enabled with SSL**

1. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC1 which is connected to Access Point through LAN.

2. Update the **mosquitto.conf** file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

3. Also, add **certs** folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

4. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port should be 8883)

   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
   **![Run MQTTS server](resources/readme/mqtts_server.png)**

5. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version **tlsv1**, just comment the **tls_version tlsv1** in **mosquitto.conf** file.

**Note**:
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to broker, add the below lines in **mosquitto.conf** file:

  ```c
  listener 8886
  allow_anonymous true
  ```

> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  `mosquitto -v -p 8886 -c config/mosquitto.conf`
  where **config** is the sub folder and **mosquitto.conf** is the different config file than default.

### 4.5 Additional Information

**Steps to set up MQTT server**

1. To run MQTT broker on port 8886 in Windows PC1, open command prompt and go to MQTT installed folder (Ex: C:\Program Files\mosquitto) and run the following command:

   ```c
   mosquitto.exe â€“p 8886 â€“v
   ```

   **![Run MQTT broker in Windows PC1](resources/readme/mqtt_server.png)**

2. Open MQTT Explorer in Windows PC2 and delete the existing connections if any and click on **Advanced** as shown in the below image.

   **![Delete the existing connections](resources/readme/delete_connections.png)**

3. Delete the existing topic names if any. Enter the desired **TOPIC_NAME** in topic field and click on **ADD**. Then the desired topic name can be observed in the topic list and click on **BACK** as shown in below image.

   **![Add TOPIC NAME in topic field](resources/readme/add_topic_name.png)**

4. Connect to MQTT broker by giving IP address and port number of Windows PC1 in HOST and PORT fields in MQTT Explorer respectively and click on **CONNECT** to connect to the MQTT broker. If you are running your MQTT broker on the same PC then the following configuration is made as shown in the below image.
