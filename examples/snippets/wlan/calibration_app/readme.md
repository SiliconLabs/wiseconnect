### 4.1 Configure the Application

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

1. In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the SiWx91x SoftAP's Wi-Fi network shall be advertised.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
  ```

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
  ```

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type of the Access point. The supported security modes are mentioned in `sl_wifi_security_t`.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE SL_WIFI_WPA_WPA2_MIXED
  ```

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure. 

2. Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to test throughput app as per requirements

To set TX power in dBm. The valid values are from 2dbm to 18dbm for WiSeConnectTM module.

```c
#define TX_TEST_POWER                         18
```
  
To set transmit data rate.

```c
#define TX_TEST_RATE                          0
```
   
To configure length of the TX packet. Valid values are in the range of 24 to 1500 bytes in the burst mode and range of 24 to 260 bytes in the continuous mode.

```c
#define TX_TEST_LENGTH                        30
```
   
To configure Burst mode or Continuous mode

```c
#define TX_TEST_MODE                           BURST_MODE
```
   
To configure the channel number in 2.4 GHz or 5GHz. Here mention the channel number.

```c
#define TEST_CHANNEL                       1
```
### 4.2 Build the application

- SoC mode: Build as Calibration App Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_project.png)**

- NCP mode:

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

1. Make connections as per setup diagram (above) and set the appropriate settings on the Spectrum Analyzer by using the steps mentioned in below **Spectrum Analyzer Settings**.

2. After the program gets executed, the SiWx91x device will start the transmit test with the given configuration.

3. Refer the below image which shows when SiWx91x device transmits packets in Burst mode with different Tx power and different transmission rates in channel 1 with length 1000bytes.

   ```sh 
   #define TX_TEST_POWER   18
   #define TX_TEST_RATE    0
   #define TX_TEST_LENGTH  30
   #define TX_TEST_MODE    BURST_MODE
   #define TEST_CHANNEL    1
   ```

4. Observe the Avg Freq Error (highlighted) on the screen and now try to adjust the frequency offset by using CLI commands with serial terminal (Docklight or Teraterm)
   
![Avg Freq Error (highlighted) on the screen](resources/readme/image_c7.png)


### Frequency Offset Correction

Frequency offset correction will be done by using the sl_si91x_frequency_offset command. This command is used during the RF calibration process and requires PER mode transmissions to be initiated prior. This command sends freq_offset (deviation) as observed on the signal analyzer against the expected channel frequency.

   
Prototype :  
> `frequency_offset_in_khz = freq_offset_in_khz <CR><LF>`  
> 
> Here freq_offset_in_khz means Frequency deviation in KHz or ppm
   
   
Examples :
> `frequency_offset_in_khz=10<CR><LF>`
>
> `frequency_offset_in_khz=-10<CR><LF>` 

> **Note:** User can use the above command for any number of times till it gets tuned to desired frequency offset.

Open the serial terminal (Docklight/TeraTerm tool) and enter the following commands. User can provide input to correct frequency offset by sending the commands on console. This should lead towards a correction in the frequency offset as observed earlier and repeat till the error is within the tolerance limits (+/- 2 KHz tolerance limits).

See the below picture after frequency offset correction.

![After frequency offset correction](resources/readme/image_c9.png)

> **Note:** freq_offset_in_khz can be either +ve or -ve. When user enters the freq offset as observed on signal analyzer (+ve/-ve), a small freq offset correction is done. User needs to iterate this till the freq offset is within tolerance limits.

### Gain Offset Correction:

#### Update XO Ctune and Gain Offset

Using sl_si91x_calibration_write command the calibrated XO Ctune and calculated gain offset can be updated to target memory (Flash/Efuse).

   ```sh
   Prototype :
   sl_si91x_calibration_write = <sl_si91x_calib_write_t calib_write> 
   ```

   |

> **Note:** For SiWx917, the user needs to calibrate gain-offset for low sub-band (channel-1), mid sub-band (channel-6), and high sub-band (channel-11) and input the three gain-offsets to this API and set the corresponding flags to validate it. 

> **Precondition:** 
sl_si91x_frequency_offset command needs to be called before this command when xo ctune value from hardware register is to be used. 

Gain offset can be calculated using the following equation :

   gain_offset = observed_power_level + cable_loss - configured_power_level

Example :

   gain_offset = 14.3 + 1.7 (assuming) - 18 = -2 dBm

For 2 GHz band, the gain offset has to calibrated for three channels, viz. channel-1, channel-6, channel-11. After the three gain offsets are calculated these can be written to Flash using the `sl_si91x_calibration_write` command.

> NOTE : 
> The gain_offset can be negative but not a floating value.
> Once the frequency offset is corrected after multiple tries, sl_si91x_calibration_write commands has to be given once for all to write the values to flash.

The application reads the updated calibration values for verification by using `sl_si91x_calibration_read` command and displays.

### Spectrum Analyzer Settings
**Below are the necessary settings to see Polar Graph Spectrum Analyzer settings**
1. Frequency channel â†’ center frequencyâ†’ 2412MHz for channel1.

2. SpanX scale â†’ spanâ†’ 50MHz

3. Mode â†’ WLAN â†’ Mode setup â†’ Radio Std â†’ 802.11a/b/g â†’ 802.11 b/g

4. Trigger â†’ RF Burst

The frequency error section shows the error that needs to be adjusted. Using `sl_si91x_frequency_offset` and `sl_si91x_calibration_write` command user should be able to adjust the frequency error.
