For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment
The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

#### In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network

- **STA instance related parameters**

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.
 
   ```c
   #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
   ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

   ```c
   #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE"

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

     - ENABLE_MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_PUBLISH is provided to enable or disable MQTT subscribe, publish, and disconnect in the application. If disabled (set to 0), the MQTT client connects to the broker and remains idle without any activity. If enabled (set to 1), it subscribes, publishes, and disconnects from the broker. 

      ```c
      #define ENABLE_MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_PUBLISH 0
      ```

> Note:
> ENABLE_MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_PUBLISH is disabled by default because the purpose of this application is to demonstrate power performance with TWT and without MQTT connection loss.
 
- MQTT_BROKER_PORT port refers to the port number on which the remote MQTT broker/server is running.

     ```c
     #define MQTT_BROKER_PORT                                8886

     ```c
     #define QOS_OF_PUBLISH_MESSAGE 0
     ```

- IS_DUPLICATE_MESSAGE indicates whether message sent by MQTT client is a duplicated message.

     ```c
     #define IS_DUPLICATE_MESSAGE 0
     ```

- iTWT Configuration

     To configure iTWT parameters open **app.c**.
     There are three TWT configuration APIs. 
     >
     > - **sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection** - This API calculates and automatically configures suitable TWT parameters based on the given inputs. Enables or disables a TWT session. Recommended for user applications. 
     > - **sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time** - This API allows users to manually configure iTWT session parameters and enables the iTWT session. This API is not recommended for users. It is for internal certification purposes only.
     > - **sl_wifi_disable_target_wake_time** - Disables a TWT session.


     **sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API:**

     ```c
     sl_status_t sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection(sl_wifi_twt_selection_t *twt_auto_request)
     ```

     This TWT API is recommended because it's designed for maintaining connections, improving throughput, and enhancing power performance.

     Input parameter descriptions are as follows:

     - **twt_enable** : TWT enable. 0 - TWT session teardown; 1 - TWT session setup.
     - **average_tx_throughput** : This is the expected average Tx throughput in Kbps. Value ranges from 0 to 10Mbps, which is half of the default [device_average_throughput](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-wi-fi/sl-wifi-twt-selection-t#device-average-throughput) (20Mbps by default).
     - **tx_latency** : The allowed latency, in milliseconds, within which the given Tx operation is expected to be completed. If 0 is configured, maximum allowed Tx latency is same as rx_latency. Otherwise, valid values are in the range of [200ms - 6hrs].
     - **rx_latency** : The maximum latency, in milliseconds, for receiving buffered packets from the AP. The device wakes up at least once for a TWT service period within the configured rx_latency if there are any pending packets destined for the device from the AP. If set to 0, the default latency of 2 seconds is used. Valid range is between 2 seconds to 6 hours. Recommended range is 2 seconds to 60 seconds to avoid connection failures with AP due to longer sleep time.

     For more information on input parameters, refer [sl_wifi_twt_selection_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-wi-fi/sl-wifi-twt-selection-t).

     Enable TWT_AUTO_CONFIG MACRO in the app.c file to enable usage of this API.

     ```c
     #define TWT_AUTO_CONFIG         1
     ```
     Given below are sample configurations.

     ```c
          sl_wifi_twt_selection_t default_twt_selection_configuration = {
          .twt_enable                            = 1,
          .average_tx_throughput                 = 1000,
          .tx_latency                            = 0,
          .rx_latency                            = 5000,
          .device_average_throughput             = DEVICE_AVERAGE_THROUGHPUT,
          .estimated_extra_wake_duration_percent = ESTIMATE_EXTRA_WAKE_DURATION_PERCENT,
          .twt_tolerable_deviation               = TWT_TOLERABLE_DEVIATION,
          .default_wake_interval_ms              = TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_INTERVAL_MS,
          .default_minimum_wake_duration_ms      = TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_DURATION_MS,
          .beacon_wake_up_count_after_sp         = MAX_BEACON_WAKE_UP_AFTER_SP
          };
     ```
     - The following are the default macro settings. User should not change these values as it may affect the working of the algorithm. 

     ```c
     #define DEVICE_AVG_THROUGHPUT                20000    // Kbps
     #define ESTIMATE_EXTRA_WAKE_DURATION_PERCENT 0        // in percentage
     #define TWT_TOLERABLE_DEVIATION              10       // in percentage
     #define TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_INTERVAL_MS         1024     // in milli seconds
     #define TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_DURATION_MS         16       // in milli seconds
     #define MAX_TX_AND_RX_LATENCY_LIMIT          22118400 // 6hrs in milli seconds
     #define MAX_BEACON_WAKE_UP_AFTER_SP \
     2 // The number of beacons after the service period completion for which the module wakes up and listens for any pending RX.
     ```

     >**Note** : 
     >
     > WLAN Keep Alive should not be disabled while using this API.

          
     **sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API**

     Usage of this API requires knowledge of individual TWT setup negotiation. This API doesn't take care of network disconnections.
     ```c
     sl_status_t sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time(sl_wifi_twt_request_t *twt_req)
     ```

     iTWT parameters should be configured and filled into the structure type *sl_wifi_twt_request_t*  in app.c and passed as a parameter to *sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time()* API.

     Given below are sample configurations.

     ```c
     sl_wifi_twt_request_t default_twt_setup_configuration = {
     .twt_enable              = 1,
     .twt_flow_id             = 1,
     .wake_duration           = 0x80,
     .wake_duration_unit      = 0,
     .wake_duration_tol       = 0x80,
     .wake_int_exp            = 13,
     .wake_int_exp_tol        = 13,
     .wake_int_mantissa       = 0x1B00,
     .wake_int_mantissa_tol   = 0x1B00,
     .implicit_twt            = 1,
     .un_announced_twt        = 1,
     .triggered_twt           = 0,
     .twt_channel             = 0,
     .twt_protection          = 0,
     .restrict_tx_outside_tsp = 1,
     .twt_retry_limit         = 6,
     .twt_retry_interval      = 10,
     .req_type                = 1,
     .negotiation_type        = 0,
     };
     ```

    These parameters with their limits are defined as below.

    - **twt_enable**:  1- Setup ; 0 - teardown
    - **twt_flow_id**: range 0-7 or 0xFF
    - **twt_req_params**: Structure with parameters in case of setup and NULL in case of teardown.
    - **wake_duration**: This is the nominal minimum wake duration of TWT. This is the time for which DUT will be in wake state for Transmission or reception of data. Allowed values range is  0-255.
    - **wake_duration_unit**: This parameter defines unit for wake_duration. Allowed values are  0 (256uS) and 1 (1024uS).
    - **wake_duration_tol**: This is the tolerance allowed for wake duration in case of suggest TWT. Received TWT wake duration from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0-255.
    - **wake_int_exp**: TWT Wake interval exponent. It is exponent to base 2. Allowed values are 0 - 31.
    - **wake_int_exp_tol**: This is the allowed tolerance for wake_int_exp in case of suggest TWT request. Received TWT wake interval exponent from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0 - 31.
    - **wake_int_mantissa**: This is the TWT wake interval mantissa. Allowed values are 0-65535.
    - **wake_int_mantissa_tol**: This is tolerance allowed for wake_int_mantissa in case of suggest TWT. Received TWT wake interval mantissa from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0-65535.
    - **implicit_twt**: If enabled (1), the TWT requesting STA calculates the Next TWT by adding a fixed value to the current TWT value. Explicit TWT is currently not allowed.
    - **un_announced_twt**: If enabled (1), TWT requesting STA does not announce its wake up to AP through PS-POLLs or UAPSD Trigger frames.
    - **triggered_twt**: If enabled(1), at least one trigger frame is included in the TWT Service Period(TSP).
    - **twt_channel**: Currently this configuration is not supported. Allowed values are 0-7.
    - **twt_protection**:  If enabled (1), TSP is protected. This is negotiable with AP. Currently not supported. Only zero is allowed.
    - **restrict_tx_outside_tsp**: If enabled (1), any Tx outside the TSP is restricted. Else, TX can happen outside the TSP also.
    - **twt_retry_limit**: This is the maximum number of retries allowed, if the TWT response frame is not received for the sent TWT request frame. Allowed values are 0 - 15.
    - **twt_retry_interval**: The interval, in seconds, between two twt request retries. Allowed values are 5 - 255.
    - **req_type**: This is the TWT request type.
      - 0 - Request TWT
      - 1 - Suggest TWT
      - 2 - Demand TWT

    Below is the sample TWT setup API call.

     ```c
     status                          = sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time(&twt_request);
     ```

     > Note:
     >
     > - TWT Wake duration depends on the wake duration unit. For example, for the above configuration, wake duration value is  (0xE0 * 256 = 57.3 msec).
     > - TWT Wake interval is calculated as mantissa *2 ^ exp.  For example, for the above configuration, wake interval value is (0x1B00* 2^13  = 55.2 sec).
     > - Configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP.
     > - There might be disconnections while using TWT with wake interval > 4sec when connected to an AP with non-zero GTK key renewal time.
     > - Keep Alive timeout should be non-zero when negotiated TWT setup is **unannounced**, otherwise there might be disconnections.

- iTWT Teardown Configuration

     To teardown TWT session use the matching TWT teardown API corresponding to the TWT setup configuration API:
     1. For TWT parameters Auto Selection API, call the following API to teardown :
          ```c
          status = sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection(twt_selection);
          ```
          - Set twt_enable parameter to 0 in the twt_selection structure. 
          - The other parameters are ignored. 

     2. For manually configurable TWT parameters API, call the following API to teardown:
          ```c
          status = sl_wifi_disable_target_wake_time(&twt_req);
          ```
          * twt_req->twt_enable should be set to '0' for teardown operation.
          * twt_req->twt_flow_id should be configured as described below: 
               * This paramater value range is 0-7. It should be same as setup flow ID, other wise error will be triggered.
               * 0xFF - To teardown all active sessions. This value is valid only in case of teardown command.
          * Rest of the parameters in the structure are ignored for a Teardown operation.  

     > Note : For setting a new TWT session, the existing TWT session must be teared down.

## iTWT Session Status Codes

User can get asynchronous TWT session updates if *twt_response_handler* is defined and the callback is registered. A *twt_response_handler* is provided in the example application. The following are the TWT session status codes.
|S.No|  MACRO|  Session status code|  Description|
|:----|:------|:-------------------|:--------------|
|1.|  TWT_SESSION_SUCC| 0|  TWT session setup success. TWT session is active.|
|2.|  TWT_UNSOL_SESSION_SUCC| 1|  Unsolicited TWT setup response from AP accepted. TWT session is active.|
|3.|  TWT_SETUP_AP_REJECTED|  4|  TWT Reject frame received in response for the sent TWT setup frame.|

## TWT Recommendations 

1. Use sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection with appropriate Rx Latency input according to the use case as it has improved design over sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time. Also, it handles network level disconnections such as ARP, Embedded MQTT and TCP connections. It has better user interface and simplifies TWT usage.
2. iTWT setup is recommended after IP assignment/TCP connection/application connection.
3. When using sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API, Rx Latency should be less than TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side.
4. When using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API, TWT interval configured should be less than TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side.
5. For iTWT, GTK Interval Should be kept maximum possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time) / RX Latency (in case of sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API) is less than 4sec.
6. When sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wakeup interval less than or equal to 1 min.
7. WLAN Keep Alive timeout should **not** be disabled when sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API is used or when unannounced TWT session is set up using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API. It is recommended to use WLAN Keep Alive timeout of 30 sec which is the default timeout even if not configured specifically by the user.

**Soc Mode**:

The M4 processor is set in sleep mode. The M4 processor can be woken in several ways as mentioned below:

- ALARM timer-based - In this method, an ALARM timer is run that wakes the M4 processor up periodically every **ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME** time period.
  - We can enable the ALARM timer-wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_ALARM_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.
  - In the Project explorer pane, expand as follows wiseconnect3_sdk_xxx > components > device > silabs > si91x > mcu > drivers > peripheral_drivers > src folder and open sl_si91x_m4_ps.c file. Configure **ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME**, in seconds, in sl_si91x_m4_ps.c
- Button press-based (GPIO) - In this method, the M4 processor wakes up upon pressing a button (BTN0).
  - We can enable the Button press-based wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_BUTTON_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.
- Wireless-based - When an RX packet is to be received by the TA, the M4 processor is woken up.
  - We can enable the Wireless-wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_WIRELESS_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application
- Flash, run and debug the application

- Once the SiWx91x gets connected to the MQTT broker, if ENABLE_MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_PUBLISH is enabled, it will subscribe to the topic **TOPIC_TO_BE_SUBSCRIBED (Ex: "THERMOSTAT-DATA")**. The user can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.

   **![Client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/connect_subscribe.png)**

- SiWx91x publishes a message which is given in **PUBLISH_MESSAGE**
  (Ex: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do") on **PUBLISH_TOPIC(Ex: THERMOSTAT-DATA)**

- MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the SiWx91x EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.

   **![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the SiWx91x EVK](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under **Publish** tab, select **raw** data format, type the data that user wishes to send and then click on **publish**. This message will be received by the SiWx91x.

    **![To publish a message using MQTT Explorer](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- In the MQTT broker and on the terminal, user can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed to that topic.

   **![In MQTT broker, user can observe the published message](resources/readme/publish_msg.png)**

- SiWx91x unsubscribes to the topic that it has subscribe after receiving the message that was published by MQTT Explorer running on Windows PC2.

- Once subscription is successful, SiWx91x disconnects from the broker.

**Procedure for executing the application when enabled with SSL**

1. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC1 which is connected to Access Point through LAN.

2. Update the **mosquito.conf** file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

3. Also, add **certs** folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

4. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port should be 8883)

   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
   **![Run MQTTS server](resources/readme/mqtts_server.png)**

5. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version **tlsv1**, just comment the **tls_version tlsv1** in **mosquitto.conf** file.

**Note**:
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to broker, add the below lines in **mosquitto.conf** file:

  ```c
  listener 8886
  allow_anonymous true
  ```

> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  `mosquitto -v -p 8886 -c config/mosquitto.conf`
  where **config** is the sub folder and **mosquitto.conf** is the different config file than default.

   ```c
   mosquitto.exe –p 8886 –v
   ```

   **![Run MQTT broker in Windows PC1](resources/readme/mqtt_server.png)**

2. Open MQTT Explorer in Windows PC2 and delete the existing connections if any and click on **Advanced** as shown in the below image.

   **![Delete the existing connections](resources/readme/delete_connections.png)**

3. Delete the existing topic names if any. Enter the desired **TOPIC_NAME** in topic field and click on **ADD**. Then the desired topic name can be observed in the topic list and click on **BACK** as shown in below image.

   **![Add TOPIC NAME in topic field](resources/readme/add_topic_name.png)**

4. Connect to MQTT broker by giving IP address and port number of Windows PC1 in HOST and PORT fields in MQTT Explorer respectively and click on **CONNECT** to connect to the MQTT broker. If you are running your MQTT broker on the same PC then the following configuration is made as shown in the below image.
