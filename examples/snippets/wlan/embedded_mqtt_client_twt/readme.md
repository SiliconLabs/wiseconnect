- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

## Application Build Environment
The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

#### In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network

- **STA instance related parameters**

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.
 
   ```c
   #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
   ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

   ```c

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

     - ENABLE_MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_PUBLISH is provided to enable or disable MQTT subscribe, publish, and disconnect in the application. If disabled (set to 0), the MQTT client connects to the broker and remains idle without any activity. If enabled (set to 1), it subscribes, publishes, and disconnects from the broker. 

      ```c
      #define ENABLE_MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_PUBLISH 0
      ```

>Note:
 > ENABLE_MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_PUBLISH is disabled by default because the purpose of this application is to demonstrate power performance with TWT and without MQTT connection loss.

- iTWT Configuration

     There are three TWT configuration APIs. 

     > - sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection - This API calculates and automatically configures TWT parameters based on the given inputs. Enables or disables a TWT session.
     > - sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time - This API allows users to manually configure iTWT session parameters and enables the iTWT session.
     > - sl_wifi_disable_target_wake_time - Disables a TWT session.

     **sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API:**

     ```c
     sl_status_t sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection(sl_wifi_twt_selection_t *twt_auto_request)
     ```

     Enable TWT_AUTO_CONFIG MACRO in the app.c file.

     Given below are sample configurations.

     ```c
     sl_wifi_twt_selection_t default_twt_selection_configuration = {
     .twt_enable                            = 1,
     .average_tx_throughput                 = 1000,
     .tx_latency                            = 0,
     .rx_latency                            = 5000,
     .device_average_throughput             = DEVICE_AVERAGE_THROUGHPUT,
     .estimated_extra_wake_duration_percent = ESTIMATE_EXTRA_WAKE_DURATION_PERCENT,
     .twt_tolerable_deviation               = TWT_TOLERABLE_DEVIATION,
     .default_wake_interval_ms              = TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_INTERVAL_MS,
     .default_minimum_wake_duration_ms      = TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_DURATION_MS,
     .beacon_wake_up_count_after_sp         = MAX_BEACON_WAKE_UP_AFTER_SP
     };
     ```

     Sample API call is given as below : 

     ```c
     status                            = sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection(&performance_profile.twt_selection);
     ```

     There are default macro settings that are used for calculating the iTWT parameters. 

     Sample Macro Settings : 

     ```c
     #define DEVICE_AVERAGE_THROUGHPUT            20000 \\ KBPS
     #define ESTIMATE_EXTRA_WAKE_DURATION_PERCENT 0 \\ in percentage
     #define TWT_TOLERABLE_DEVIATION              10 \\ in percentage
     #define TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_INTERVAL_MS         1024     // in milli seconds
     #define TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_DURATION_MS         16       // in milli seconds
     #define MAX_TX_AND_RX_LATENCY_LIMIT          22118400 // 6hrs in milli seconds
     #define MAX_BEACON_WAKE_UP_AFTER_SP \
     2 // The number of beacons after the service period completion for which the module wakes up and listens for any pending RX.
     ```

     >**Note** : 
     >
     > WLAN Keep Alive should not be disabled while using this API.

     
     **sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API:**

     ```c
     sl_status_t sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time(sl_wifi_twt_request_t *twt_req)
     ```

     iTWT parameters should be configured and filled into the structure type *sl_wifi_twt_request_t*  in app.c and passed as a parameter to *sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time()* API.

     Given below are sample configurations.

     ```c
     sl_wifi_twt_request_t default_twt_setup_configuration = {
     .twt_enable              = 1,
     .twt_flow_id             = 1,
     .wake_duration           = 0x80,
     .wake_duration_unit      = 0,
     .wake_duration_tol       = 0x80,
     .wake_int_exp            = 13,
     .wake_int_exp_tol        = 13,
     .wake_int_mantissa       = 0x1B00,
     .wake_int_mantissa_tol   = 0x1B00,
     .implicit_twt            = 1,
     .un_announced_twt        = 1,
     .triggered_twt           = 0,
     .twt_channel             = 0,
     .twt_protection          = 0,
     .restrict_tx_outside_tsp = 1,
     .twt_retry_limit         = 6,
     .twt_retry_interval      = 10,
     .req_type                = 1,
     .negotiation_type        = 0,
     };
     ```

     Below is the sample TWT setup API call.

     ```c
     status                          = sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time(&twt_request);
     ```

     > Note:
     >
     > - TWT Wake duration depends on the wake duration unit. For example, for the above configuration, wake duration value is  (0xE0 * 256 = 57.3 msec).
     > - TWT Wake interval is calculated as mantissa *2 ^ exp.  For example, for the above configuration, wake interval value is (0x1B00* 2^13  = 55.2 sec).
     > - Configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP.
     > - There might be disconnections while using TWT with wake interval > 4sec when connected to an AP with non-zero GTK key renewal time.
     > - Keep Alive timeout should be non-zero when negotiated TWT setup is **unannounced**, otherwise there might be disconnections.

- iTWT Teardown Configuration

     To teardown TWT session use the matching TWT teardown API corresponding to the TWT setup configuration API:
     1. For TWT parameters Auto Selection API, call the following API to teardown :
          ```c
          status = sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection(twt_selection);
          ```
          - Set twt_enable parameter to 0 in the twt_selection structure. 
          - The other parameters are ignored. 

     2. For manually configurable TWT parameters API, call the following API to teardown:
          ```c
          status = sl_wifi_disable_target_wake_time(&twt_req);
          ```
          * twt_req->twt_enable should be set to '0' for teardown operation.
          * twt_req->twt_flow_id should be configured as described below: 
               * This paramater value range is 0-7. It should be same as setup flow ID, other wise error will be triggered.
               * 0xFF - To teardown all active sessions. This value is valid only in case of teardown command.
          * Rest of the parameters in the structure are ignored for a Teardown operation.  

     > Note : For setting a new TWT session, the existing TWT session must be teared down.

## iTWT Session Status Codes

User can get asynchronous TWT session updates if *twt_response_handler* is defined and the callback is registered. A *twt_response_handler* is provided in the example application. The following are the TWT session status codes.
|S.No|  MACRO|  Session status code|  Description|
|:----|:------|:-------------------|:--------------|
|1.|  TWT_SESSION_SUCC| 0|  TWT session setup success. TWT session is active.|
|2.|  TWT_UNSOL_SESSION_SUCC| 1|  Unsolicited TWT setup response from AP accepted. TWT session is active.|
|3.|  TWT_SETUP_AP_REJECTED|  4|  TWT Reject frame received in response for the sent TWT setup frame.|
|4.|  TWT_SETUP_RSP_OUTOF_TOL|5|  TWT response parameters from AP for TWT Suggest request is not within tolerance set by User.|
|5.|  TWT_SETUP_RSP_NOT_MATCHED|  6|  TWT response parameters from AP for TWT Demand request does not match parameters given by User.|
|6.|  TWT_SETUP_UNSUPPORTED_RSP|  10| Unsupported TWT response from AP.|
|7.|  TWT_TEARDOWN_SUCC|  11| TWT session teardown success|
|8.|  TWT_AP_TEARDOWN_SUCC| 12| TWT session teardown from AP success|
|9.|  TWT_SETUP_FAIL_MAX_RETRIES_REACHED| 15| TWT setup request retried maximum number of times as configured by user.|
|10.| TWT_INACTIVE_DUETO_ROAMING| 16  |TWT session inactive due to roaming|
|11.| TWT_INACTIVE_DUETO_DISCONNECT|  17| TWT session inactive due to disconnect|
|12.| TWT_INACTIVE_NO_AP_SUPPORT| 18| TWT session inactive as connected AP does not support TWT.|

> Note:
> **twt_session_active** variable is provided in the example application and is updated according to the asychronous TWT session notifications. User can utilise this variable to teardown or configure new session parameters depending upon existing session status. 


## TWT Recommendations 

1. Use sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection with appropriate Rx Latency input according to the user scenario as it has improved  design over sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time, handles Embedded MQTT level disconnections and has better user interface. 
2. iTWT setup is recommended after IP assignment/TCP connection/application connection.
3. When using sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API, Rx Latency  should be less than TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side.
4. When using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time, TWT interval configured should be less than TCP / ARP Timeouts at the remote side.
5. For iTWT, GTK Interval Should be kept maximum possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time) / RX Latency (in case of sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API) is less than 4sec.
6. When sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wakeup interval less than or equal to 1 min.
7. WLAN Keep Alive timeout should **not** be disabled when sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API is used or when unannounced TWT session is set up using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API. It is recommended to use WLAN Keep Alive timeout of 30 sec which is the default timeout even if not configured specifically by the user.

**Soc Mode**:

The M4 processor is set in sleep mode. The M4 processor can be woken in several ways as mentioned below:

- ALARM timer-based - In this method, an ALARM timer is run that wakes the M4 processor up periodically every **ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME** time period.
  - We can enable the ALARM timer-wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_ALARM_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.
  - In the Project explorer pane, expand as follows wiseconnect3_sdk_xxx > components > device > silabs > si91x > mcu > drivers > peripheral_drivers > src folder and open sl_si91x_m4_ps.c file. Configure **ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME**, in seconds, in sl_si91x_m4_ps.c
- Button press-based (GPIO) - In this method, the M4 processor wakes up upon pressing a button (BTN0).
  - We can enable the Button press-based wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_BUTTON_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.
- Wireless-based - When an RX packet is to be received by the TA, the M4 processor is woken up.
  - We can enable the Wireless-wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_WIRELESS_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application
- Flash, run and debug the application

- Once the SiWx91x gets connected to the MQTT broker, if ENABLE_MQTT_SUBSCRIBE_PUBLISH is enabled, it will subscribe to the topic **TOPIC_TO_BE_SUBSCRIBED (Ex: "THERMOSTAT-DATA")**. The user can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.

   **![Client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/connect_subscribe.png)**

- SiWx91x publishes a message which is given in **PUBLISH_MESSAGE**
  (Ex: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do") on **PUBLISH_TOPIC(Ex: THERMOSTAT-DATA)**

- MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the SiWx91x EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.

   **![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the SiWx91x EVK](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under **Publish** tab, select **raw** data format, type the data that user wishes to send and then click on **publish**. This message will be received by the SiWx91x.

    **![To publish a message using MQTT Explorer](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- In the MQTT broker and on the terminal, user can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed to that topic.

   **![In MQTT broker, user can observe the published message](resources/readme/publish_msg.png)**

- SiWx91x unsubscribes to the topic that it has subscribe after receiving the message that was published by MQTT Explorer running on Windows PC2.

- Once subscription is successful, SiWx91x disconnects from the broker.

**Procedure for executing the application when enabled with SSL**

1. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC1 which is connected to Access Point through LAN.

2. Update the **mosquito.conf** file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

3. Also, add **certs** folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

4. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port should be 8883)

   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
   **![Run MQTTS server](resources/readme/mqtts_server.png)**

5. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version **tlsv1**, just comment the **tls_version tlsv1** in **mosquitto.conf** file.

**Note**:
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to broker, add the below lines in **mosquitto.conf** file:

  ```c
  listener 8886
  allow_anonymous true
  ```

> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  `mosquitto -v -p 8886 -c config/mosquitto.conf`
  where **config** is the sub folder and **mosquitto.conf** is the different config file than default.
