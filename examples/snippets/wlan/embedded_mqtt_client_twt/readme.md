#### 4.1.2 **iTWT Configuration**

There are three TWT configuration APIs. 
> * sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection - This API calculates and automatically configures TWT parameters based on the given inputs. Enables or disables a TWT session.
> * sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time - Configures user given TWT parameters. Enables a TWT session.
> * sl_wifi_disable_target_wake_time - Disables a TWT session.

**sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection**

```c
sl_status_t sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection(sl_wifi_twt_selection_t *twt_auto_request)
```

Parameters of this API can be configured in *sl_wifi_twt_selection_t* structure. Below given are the parameter descriptions:
- twt_enable  :  1- Setup ; 0 - teardown
- tx_latency  :  The period, in milliseconds, within which the given Tx operation needs to be completed. Valid values is either 0 or in the range of [200ms - 6hrs]
- rx_latency  :  The maximum allowed receive latency, in milliseconds, when an Rx packet is buffered at the AP. If rx_latency is less than <= 1sec (except 0), session creation is not possible. For default configuration, input 0.
- avg_tx_throughput  :  The expected average throughput, in Kilo Bytes per seconds, to be achieved within the Tx latency. Valid value is 0 to half of Device Throughput ( = 20MBPS / 2).

Enable TWT_AUTO_CONFIG MACRO in the app.c file.

Given below are sample configurations.
```c
sl_wifi_twt_selection_t default_twt_selection_configuration = {
  .twt_enable                            = 1,
  .average_tx_throughput                 = 1000,
  .tx_latency                            = 0,
  .rx_latency                            = 5000,
  .device_average_throughput             = DEVICE_AVERAGE_THROUGHPUT,
  .estimated_extra_wake_duration_percent = ESTIMATE_EXTRA_WAKE_DURATION_PERCENT,
  .twt_tolerable_deviation               = TWT_TOLERABLE_DEVIATION,
  .default_wake_interval_ms              = TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_INTERVAL_MS,
  .default_minimum_wake_duration_ms      = TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_DURATION_MS,
  .beacon_wake_up_count_after_sp         = MAX_BEACON_WAKE_UP_AFTER_SP
};
```
Sample API call is given as below : 
```c
status                            = sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection(&performance_profile.twt_selection);
```
There are default macro settings that are used for calculating the iTWT parameters. 

Sample Macro Settings : 
```c
#define DEVICE_AVG_THROUGHPUT                20000 \\ KBPS
#define ESTIMATE_EXTRA_WAKE_DURATION_PERCENT 0 \\ in percentage
#define TWT_TOLERABLE_DEVIATION              10 \\ in percentage
#define TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_INTERVAL_MS         1024     // in milli seconds
#define TWT_DEFAULT_WAKE_DURATION_MS         16       // in milli seconds
#define MAX_TX_AND_RX_LATENCY_LIMIT          22118400 // 6hrs in milli seconds
#define MAX_BEACON_WAKE_UP_AFTER_SP \
  2 // The number of beacons after the service period completion for which the module wakes up and listens for any pending RX.
```
Note :  WLAN Keep Alive should not be disabled while using this API.

**sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API**

```c
sl_status_t sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time(sl_wifi_twt_request_t *twt_req)
```

iTWT parameters should be configured and filled into the structure type *sl_wifi_twt_request_t*  in app.c and passed as a parameter to *sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time()* API.

Given below are sample configurations.

```c
sl_wifi_twt_request_t default_twt_setup_configuration = {
  .twt_enable              = 1,
  .twt_flow_id             = 1,
  .wake_duration           = 0x80,
  .wake_duration_unit      = 0,
  .wake_duration_tol       = 0x80,
  .wake_int_exp            = 13,
  .wake_int_exp_tol        = 13,
  .wake_int_mantissa       = 0x1B00,
  .wake_int_mantissa_tol   = 0x1B00,
  .implicit_twt            = 1,
  .un_announced_twt        = 1,
  .triggered_twt           = 0,
  .twt_channel             = 0,
  .twt_protection          = 0,

  .twt_retry_interval      = 10,
  .req_type                = 1,
  .negotiation_type        = 0,
};
```
These parameters with their limits are defined as below.

- **twt_enable**:  1- Setup ; 0 - teardown
- **twt_flow_id**: range 0-7 or 0xFF
- **twt_req_params**: Structure with parameters in case of setup and NULL in case of teardown.
- **wake_duration**: This is the nominal minimum wake duration of TWT. This is the time for which DUT will be in wake state for Transmission or reception of data. Allowed values range is  0-255.
- **wake_duration_unit**: This parameter defines unit for wake_duration. Allowed values are  0 (256uS) and 1 (1024uS).
- **wake_duration_tol**: This is the tolerance allowed for wake duration in case of suggest TWT. Received TWT wake duration from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0-255.
- **wake_int_exp**: TWT Wake interval exponent. It is exponent to base 2. Allowed values are 0 - 31.
- **wake_int_exp_tol**: This is the allowed tolerance for wake_int_exp in case of suggest TWT request. Received TWT wake interval exponent from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0 - 31.
- **wake_int_mantissa**: This is the TWT wake interval mantissa. Allowed values are 0-65535.
- **wake_int_mantissa_tol**: This is tolerance allowed for wake_int_mantissa in case of suggest TWT. Received TWT wake interval mantissa from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0-65535.
- **implicit_twt**: If enabled (1), the TWT requesting STA calculates the Next TWT by adding a fixed value to the current TWT value. Explicit TWT is currently not allowed.
- **un_announced_twt**: If enabled (1), TWT requesting STA does not announce its wake up to AP through PS-POLLs or UAPSD Trigger frames.
- **triggered_twt**: If enabled(1), at least one trigger frame is included in the TWT Service Period(TSP).
- **twt_channel**: Currently this configuration is not supported. Allowed values are 0-7.
- **twt_protection**:  If enabled (1), TSP is protected. This is negotiable with AP. Currently not supported. Only zero is allowed.
- **restrict_tx_outside_tsp**: If enabled (1), any Tx outside the TSP is restricted. Else, TX can happen outside the TSP also.
- **twt_retry_limit**: This is the maximum number of retries allowed, if the TWT response frame is not received for the sent TWT request frame. Allowed values are 0 - 15.
- **twt_retry_interval**: The interval, in seconds, between two twt request retries. Allowed values are 5 - 255.
- **req_type**: This is the TWT request type.
> * 0 - Request TWT
> * 1 - Suggest TWT
> * 2 - Demand TWT

Below is the sample TWT setup API call.
```c
status                          = sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time(&twt_request);
```

> Note:
> * TWT Wake duration depends on the wake duration unit. For example, for the above configuration, wake duration value is  (0xE0 * 256 = 57.3 msec).
> * TWT Wake interval is calculated as mantissa *2 ^ exp.  For example, for the above configuration, wake interval value is (0x1B00 * 2^13  = 55.2 sec).
> * Configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP.
> * There might be disconnections while using TWT with wake interval > 4sec when connected to an AP with non-zero GTK key renewal time.
> * Keep Alive timeout should be non-zero when negotiated TWT setup is **unannounced**, otherwise there might be disconnections.

**iTWT Teardown Configuration**

To teardown TWT session use the matching TWT API:
1. For TWT Auto Selection API :
```c
status = sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection(twt_selection);
```
Set twt_enable parameter to 0 in the twt_selection structure. The other parameters are ignored. 

2. For user given TWT parameters API call the API as follows:

```c
status = sl_wifi_disable_target_wake_time(&twt_req);
```
* twt_req->twt_enable should be set to '0' for teardown operation.

* twt_req->twt_flow_id should be configured as described below: 
> * This paramater value range is 0-7. It should be same as setup flow ID, other wise error will be triggered.
> * 0xFF - To teardown all active sessions. This value is valid only in case of teardown command.

* Rest of the parameters in the structure are ignored for a Teardown operation. 

> Note : For setting a new TWT session, the existing TWT session must be teared down.

#### 4.1.3 Recommendations

1. Use sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection with appropriate Rx Latency input according to the user scenario as it has improved  design over sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time, handles Embedded MQTT level disconnections and has better user interface. 
2. iTWT setup is recommended after IP assignment/TCP connection/application connection.
3. When using sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at remote side depending upon the configured Rx Latency.
4. When using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time, increase TCP / ARP Timeouts at remote side depending upon the configured TWT interval configured.
5. For iTWT, GTK Interval Should be kept maximum possible value or zero. If GTK interval is not configurable, recommended TWT interval (in case of sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time) / RX Latency (in case of sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API) is less than 4sec.
6. When sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API is used, configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP. Recommended to use TWT wakeup interval less than or equal to 1 min.
7. WLAN Keep Alive timeout should not be disabled when sl_wifi_target_wake_time_auto_selection API is used or when unannounced TWT session is set up using sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time API. It is recommended to use WLAN Keep Alive timeout of 30 sec.

### 4.2 Build the application

- SoC mode:

    ![build_example](resources/readme/mqtt_twt_build.png)

- NCP mode:

   ![build_example](resources/readme/mqtt_twt_build_ncp.png)

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

  - SoC

    ![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/program_device.png)

  - NCP

    ![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/program_device.png)

- Once the SiWx91x gets connected to the MQTT broker, it will subscribe to the topic **TOPIC_TO_BE_SUBSCRIBED (Ex: "THERMOSTAT-DATA")**. The user can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.

   **![Client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/connect_subscribe.png)**

- SiWx91x publishes a message which is given in **PUBLISH_MESSAGE**
  (Ex: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do") on **PUBLISH_TOPIC(Ex: THERMOSTAT-DATA)**

- MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the SiWx91x EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.

   **![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the SiWx91x EVK](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under **Publish** tab, select **raw** data format, type the data that user wishes to send and then click on **publish**. This message will be received by the SiWx91x.

    **![To publish a message using MQTT Explorer](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- In the MQTT broker and on the terminal, user can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed to that topic.

   **![In MQTT broker, user can observe the published message](resources/readme/publish_msg.png)**

- SiWx91x unsubscribes to the topic that it has subscribe after receiving the message that was published by MQTT Explorer running on Windows PC2.

- Once subscription is successful, SiWx91x disconnects from the broker.

**Procedure for executing the application when enabled with SSL**

1. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC1 which is connected to Access Point through LAN.

2. Update the **mosquito.conf** file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

3. Also, add **certs** folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

4. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port should be 8883)

   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
   **![Run MQTTS server](resources/readme/mqtts_server.png)**

5. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version **tlsv1**, just comment the **tls_version tlsv1** in **mosquitto.conf** file.

**Note**:
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to broker, add the below lines in **mosquitto.conf** file:

  ```c
  listener 8886
  allow_anonymous true
  ```

> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  `mosquitto -v -p 8886 -c config/mosquitto.conf`
  where **config** is the sub folder and **mosquitto.conf** is the different config file than default.

### 4.5 Additional Information

**Steps to set up MQTT server**

1. To run MQTT broker on port 8886 in Windows PC1, open command prompt and go to MQTT installed folder (Ex: C:\Program Files\mosquitto) and run the following command: 

   ```c
   mosquitto.exe â€“p 8886 â€“v
   ```

   **![Run MQTT broker in Windows PC1](resources/readme/mqtt_server.png)**

2. Open MQTT Explorer in Windows PC2 and delete the existing connections if any and click on **Advanced** as shown in the below image.

   **![Delete the existing connections](resources/readme/delete_connections.png)**

3. Delete the existing topic names if any. Enter the desired **TOPIC_NAME** in topic field and click on **ADD**. Then the desired topic name can be observed in the topic list and click on **BACK** as shown in below image.

   **![Add TOPIC NAME in topic field](resources/readme/add_topic_name.png)**

4. Connect to MQTT broker by giving IP address and port number of Windows PC1 in HOST and PORT fields in MQTT Explorer respectively and click on **CONNECT** to connect to the MQTT broker. If you are running your MQTT broker on the same PC then the following configuration is made as shown in the below image.
