## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates to flash the firmware on the Si91x Device from the Host MCU using XMODEM protocol. The system consists of three main components:

  - Host PC: Contains the firmware file and the teraterm(Xmodem protcol) for updating firmware
  - Host MCU: Acts as an intermediary between the PC and the Si91x Device. It receives firmware data from the PC over UART and transfers it to the Si91x Device via SPI.
  - Si91x Device: The target embedded system that needs a firmware update. It receives firmware data from the Host MCU and updates its firmware.
  
## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements  

- Windows PC or Mac.
- **NCP Mode**:
  - Standalone
    - BRD4002A Wireless pro kit mainboard [SI-MB4002A]
    - EFR32xG24 Wireless 2.4 GHz +10 dBm Radio Board [xG24-RB4186C](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/xg24-rb4186c-efr32xg24-wireless-gecko-radio-board?tab=overview)

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Flash your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

### App Configuration

- By deafult the application does Fast Firmware upgrade
- For Safe Firmware upgrade, Delete this preprocessor macro in preprocessor settings, **SL_SI91X_FAST_FW_UP==1**        

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application
- Flash, run and debug the application.
- Open teraterm application, Set the baud rate to 115200 in teraterm by navigating to the Setup>Serial port>speed and click on New setting

- Then send the firmware file(.rps) by navigating to the path, file -> transfer -> xmodem -> send and select fimware file. 
- The duration for completing a firmware update can vary depending on the size of the chunks processed.
- To see application prints, follow the [Console prints](console_prints) section

**NOTE:** User must run xmodem application within 90 seconds of starting file transfer using Tera term. Tera term cancels file transfer if xmodem application is not started within 90 seconds. It is suggested that the user keeps the application compiled and ready to run before initiating file transfer using Tera term.

### Console Prints

- Open Simplicity Studio.
- From the menu, select Tools.
- In the Tools dialog, select Simplicity Commander and click OK.
  
![Figure: Select Commander](resources/readme/select-commander.png)

- In the Simplicity Commander window, click Select Kit and choose your radio board.

- In the navigation pane, go to the Console section.
- In the Console section, select the RTT tab.
- Before we start streaming the logs over RTT, make sure you have flashed the application.
- Enable the check box on Reset target on connect.
-  Click on connect
