## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure the SiWx91x multithreading in concurrent mode i.e., in both Wi-Fi Station mode (STA instance) and Access Point mode (SoftAP instance).
In this example application, the SiWx91x's STA instance is configured as an MQTT client, connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to a topic and publishes messages on a particular MQTT topic.
In this example application, configure the SiWx91x as a soft Access point and measure WLAN UDP/TCP throughput by configuring the SiWx91x in client/server role.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.
- In the Project explorer pane, open the **app.c** file. Configure the following parameters based on your requirements

- STA instance related parameters

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name to which the Si91x module gets connected to.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"
  	```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL            "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE"
  	```
  	
  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE              SL_WIFI_WPA2 
  	```
- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

- AP instance related parameters

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID refers to the SSID of the WiSeConnect softAP that would be created.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID                   "MY_AP_SSID"
  	```

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key of the WiSeConnect softAP that would be created.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL                     "MY_AP_PASSPHRASE"
    ```

> Note:
>
> 1. In concurrent mode, STA and AP should be configured on the same channel. The STA instance shall first scan for the specified external AP, wherein the channel number of AP is fetched and passed as an argument during SoftAP creation.
> 2. Valid values for CHANNEL_NO are 1 to 11 in 2.4GHz band and 36 to 48 & 149 to 165 in 5GHz. In this example, default configured band is 2.4GHz.

      ```
  - Configure the TCP RX window size and TCP RX window division factor to 44 in the socket configuration in **app.c** to achieve high throughput for TCP_RX and TLS_RX.
   
    ```c
    static sl_si91x_socket_config_t socket_config = {
      2,  // Total sockets
      2,  // Total TCP sockets
      0,  // Total UDP sockets
      0,  // TCP TX only sockets
      2,  // TCP RX only sockets
      0,  // UDP TX only sockets

### Procedure to execute the application

#### Procedure for executing throughput

##### UDP Tx Throughput

To measure UDP Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP client and start a UDP server on the remote PC.
The iPerf command to start the UDP server on the PC is:

  > `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
  >
  > For example ...
  >
  > `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -p 5001 -i 1`

  ![Figure: UDP_TX](resources/readme/image217b.png)

##### UDP Rx Throughput

To measure UDP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP server and start a UDP client on the remote PC.
The iPerf command to start the UDP client is:

  > `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -u -p <Module_Port> -i 1 -b <Bandwidth> -t <time interval in seconds>`
  >
  > For example ...
  >
  > `C:\> iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.100 -u -p 5001 -i 1 -b70M -t 30`  

  ![Figure: UDP_RX](resources/readme/image217a.png)

##### TCP Tx Throughput

To measure TCP Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a TCP client and start a TCP server on the remote PC.
The iPerf command to start the TCP server is:
  
  > `C:\> iperf.exe -s -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
  >
  > For example ...
  >
  > `C:\> iperf.exe -s -p 5001 -i 1`

  ![Figure: TCP_TX](resources/readme/image217d.png)

##### TCP Rx Throughput

To measure TCP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as TCP server and start a TCP client on the remote PC.
The iPerf command to start the TCP client is:

  > `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -p <module_PORT> -i 1 -t <time interval in sec>`
  >
  > For example ...
  >
  > `C:\> iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.100 -p 5001 -i 1 -t 30`  

  ![Figure: TCP_RX](resources/readme/image217c.png)

#### Procedure for executing Embedded Mqtt

- Once the SiWx91x gets connected to the MQTT broker, it will subscribe to the topic **TOPIC_TO_BE_SUBSCRIBED (Ex: "THERMOSTAT-DATA")**. The user can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.

   **![Client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/connect_subscribe.png)**

- SiWx91x publishes a message which is given in **PUBLISH_MESSAGE**
  (Ex: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do") on **PUBLISH_TOPIC(Ex: WiFiSDK_TOPIC)**

- MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the SiWx91x EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.

   **![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the SiWx91x EVK](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under **Publish** tab, select **raw** data format, type the data that user wishes to send and then click on **publish**. This message will be received by the SiWx91x.

    **![To publish a message using MQTT Explorer](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

- In the MQTT broker and on the terminal, user can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed to that topic.

- SiWx91x unsubscribes to the topic that it has subscribe after receiving the message that was published by MQTT Explorer running on Windows PC2.

- Once subscription is successful, SiWx91x disconnects from the broker.

### Procedure for executing the application when enabled with SSL

1. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC1 which is connected to Access Point through LAN.

2. Update the **mosquitto.conf** file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

3. Also, add **certs** folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

4. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port should be 8883)

   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
   **![Run MQTTS server](resources/readme/mqtts_server.png)**

5. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version **tlsv1**, just comment the **tls_version tlsv1** in **mosquitto.conf** file.

>**Note:**
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to broker, add the below lines in **mosquitto.conf** file:

  ```c
  listener 8886
  allow_anonymous true
  ```

> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  `mosquitto -v -p 8886 -c config/mosquitto.conf`
  where **config** is the sub folder and **mosquitto.conf** is the different config file than default.

## Additional Information

### Steps to set up MQTT server

1. To run MQTT broker on port 8886 in Windows PC1, open command prompt and go to MQTT installed folder (Ex: C:\Program Files\mosquitto) and run the following command:

   ```c
   mosquitto.exe –p 8886 –v
   ```

   **![Run MQTT broker in Windows PC1](resources/readme/mqtt_server.png)**

2. Open MQTT Explorer in Windows PC2 and delete the existing connections if any and click on **Advanced** as shown in the below image.

   **![Delete the existing connections](resources/readme/delete_connections.png)**

3. Delete the existing topic names if any. Enter the desired **TOPIC_NAME** in topic field and click on **ADD**. Then the desired topic name can be observed in the topic list and click on **BACK** as shown in below image.

   **![Add TOPIC NAME in topic field](resources/readme/add_topic_name.png)**

4. Connect to MQTT broker by giving IP address and port number of Windows PC1 in HOST and PORT fields in MQTT Explorer respectively and click on **CONNECT** to connect to the MQTT broker. If you are running your MQTT broker on the same PC then the following configuration is made as shown in the below image.
