# Station Ping

## 1 Purpose/Scope

Ping is used diagnostically to ensure that a host computer the user is trying to reach is actually operating. Ping works by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request to a specified interface on the network and waiting for a reply. The application demonstrates how to configure SiWx91x module in client mode to send ping request to target IP address.

## 2 Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

### 4.1 Configure the application

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

1. In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config/** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- **STA instance related parameters**

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.
  
     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
     ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
     ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE                             SL_WIFI_WPA2 
 	 ```
  
  - Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

2. Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to test Station Ping application

    - **Remote peer configurations**

      ```c
      #define REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS   "192.168.0.198"    // Remote/Target IPv4 address to ping
      #define PING_PACKET_SIZE    64                 // Size of ping request packet
      ```
