## Purpose/Scope

Ping is used diagnostically to ensure that a host computer that the user is trying to reach is actually operating. Ping works by sending an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Echo Request to a specified interface on the network and waiting for a reply. The application demonstrates how to configure the SiWx91x module in client mode to send a ping request to a target IP address.

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes as needed.
- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config/** folder and open the ``sl_net_default_values.h`` file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- STA instance related parameters

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and SiWx91x module is connected to it.
  
     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
     ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
     ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

    ```c
    #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE                             SL_WIFI_WPA2 
    ```
  
  - Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

> Note: 
> Users can configure default region-specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h`.

- Configure the following parameters in ``app.c`` to test Station Ping application.

  - **Remote peer configurations**

      ```c
      #define REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS   "192.168.0.198"    // Remote/Target IPv4 address to ping
      #define PING_PACKET_SIZE    64                 // Size of ping request packet
      ```

## Test the application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.
- After successful connection with the Access Point, the device starts sending ping requests to the given REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS with configured PING_PACKET_SIZE to check availability of target device.

- In rsi_station_ping.c file, when ping response comes from the remote node, it is known from the status parameter of the callback function (ping_callback_handler) registered.
