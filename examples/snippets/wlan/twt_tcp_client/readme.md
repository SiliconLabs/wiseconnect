# TCP Client with TWT feature

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the procedure to setup TWT session and configure the SiWx91x in TCP client role.

In this application, the SiWx91x connects to a Wi-Fi access point, obtains an IP address, connects to Iperf server running on a remote PC and maintains  TCP Socket connection and periodically wakes up as per the configured TWT wakeup interval in powersave.

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

### 4.1 Configure the application

1. In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- **STA instance related parameters**

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.
  
     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
     ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

     ```c 
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
     ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE              SL_WIFI_WPA2 
     ```
  
  - Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

2. Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to test throughput app as per requirements
    - `SERVER_PORT` is the remote TCP server port number on the PC running Iperf.
    - `SERVER_IP` is the remote TCP server IP address on the PC running Iperf. 
    - `NUMBER_OF_PACKETS` controls the number of packets sent to the remote TCP server.

    ```c
    #define SERVER_IP   "192.168.0.247"
    #define SERVER_PORT         5001
    #define NUMBER_OF_PACKETS   1000
    ```

#### iTWT Configuration

    - TWT (Target Wake Time) setup is only supported in 11ax (HE) connectivity. Please follow below procedure to enable TWT.
    - In the yakka file enable HIGH_EFFICIENCY_PARAMS_SUPPORT and TWT_SUPPORT.

#### iTWT Setup Configuration

    ```c
    int32_t sl_wifi_enable_target_wake_time(sl_wifi_twt_request_t *twt_request)
    ```

### iTWT Teardown Configuration

    ```c
    int32_t sl_wifi_disable_target_wake_time(sl_wifi_twt_request_t *twt_request)
    ```

    Parameters of twt_request are explained below :

    - **twt_enable**: This parameter tells whether the twt is used for setup or teardown. 1 indicates that it is setup and 0 indicates it is teardown.
    - **twt_flow_id**: This parameter identifies the type data being sent by the device. The AP will use the flow ID to determine when to wake up the device for communication. Allowed value range is 0 - 7 or 0xFF.
    - **wake_duration**: This is the nominal minimum wake duration of TWT. This is the time for which DUT will be in wake state for Transmission or reception of data. Allowed values range is  0-255.
    - **wake_duration_unit**: This parameter defines unit for wake_duration. Allowed values are  0 (256uS) and 1 (1024uS).
    - **wake_duration_tol**: This is the tolerance allowed for wake duration in case of suggest TWT. Received TWT wake duration from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0-255.
    - **wake_int_exp**: TWT Wake interval exponent. It is exponent to base 2. Allowed values are 0 - 31.
    - **wake_int_exp_tol**: This is the allowed tolerance for wake_int_exp in case of suggest TWT request. Received TWT wake interval exponent from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0 - 31.
    - **wake_int_mantissa**: This is the TWT wake interval mantissa. Allowed values are 0-65535.
    - **wake_int_mantissa_tol**: This is tolerance allowed for wake_int_mantissa in case of suggest TWT. Received TWT wake interval mantissa from AP will be validated against tolerance limits and decided if TWT config received is in acceptable range. Allowed values are 0-65535.
    - **implicit_twt**: If enabled (1), the TWT requesting STA calculates the Next TWT by adding a fixed value to the current TWT value. Explicit TWT is currently not allowed.
    - **un_announced_twt**: If enabled (1), TWT requesting STA does not announce its wake up to AP through PS-POLLs or UAPSD Trigger frames.
    - **triggered_twt**: If enabled(1), at least one trigger frame is included in the TWT Service Period(TSP).
    - **twt_channel**: Currently this configuration is not supported. Allowed values are 0-7.
    - **twt_protection**:  If enabled (1), TSP is protected. This is negotiable with AP. Currently not supported. Only zero is allowed.
    - **restrict_tx_outside_tsp**: If enabled (1), any Tx outside the TSP is restricted. Else, TX can happen outside the TSP also.
    - **twt_retry_limit**: This is the maximum number of retries allowed, if the TWT response frame is not received for the sent TWT request frame. Allowed values are 0 - 15.
    - **twt_retry_interval**: The interval, in seconds, between two twt request retries. Allowed values are 5 - 255.
    - **req_type**: This is the TWT request type.
    >
    > - 0 - Request TWT
    > - 1 - Suggest TWT
    > - 2 - Demand TWT

    Given below are sample configurations.

    ```c
            twt_request.twt_enable               = 1;
            twt_request.twt_flow_id              = 1;
            twt_request.wake_duration            = 0x60;
            twt_request.wake_duration_unit       = 0;
            twt_request.wake_duration_tol        = 0x60;
            twt_request.wake_int_exp             = 13;
            twt_request.wake_int_exp_tol         = 13;
            twt_request.wake_int_mantissa        = 0x1D4C;
            twt_request.wake_int_mantissa_tol    = 0x1D4C;
            twt_request.implicit_twt             = 1;
            twt_request.un_announced_twt         = 1;
            twt_request.triggered_twt            = 0;
            twt_request.twt_channel              = 0;
            twt_request.twt_protection           = 0;
            twt_request.restrict_tx_outside_tsp  = 1;
            twt_request.twt_retry_limit          = 6;
            twt_request.twt_retry_interval       = 10;
            twt_request.req_type                 = 1;
            twt_request.negotiation_type         = 0;
    ```

    > Note:
    >
    > - TWT Wake duration depends on the wake duration unit. For example, for the above configuration, wake duration value isÂ  (0xE0 * 256 = 57.3 msec).
    > - TWT Wake interval is calculated as mantissa *2 ^ exp.Â  For example, for the above configuration, wake interval value is (0x1B00* 2^13Â  = 55.2 sec).
    > - Configuring TWT Wake interval beyond 1 min might lead to disconnections from the AP.
    > - There might be disconnections while using TWT with wake interval > 4sec when connected to an AP with non-zero GTK key renewal time.
    > - Keep Alive timeout should be non-zero when negotiated TWT setup is **unannounced**, otherwise there might be disconnections.

### 4.2 Build the application

- SoC mode: Build as twt_tcp_client Example

    **![Build as](resources/readme/build_twt_tcp_client.png)**

- NCP mode:

    **![Build as](resources/readme/build_project_ncp.png)**

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

    ![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/program_device.png)

- Start a TCP server using the below command in command prompt.

> `C:\ iperf.exe â€“s -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`

  ![Figure: command prompt on the remote PC](resources/readme/outputs_1.png)

> If the IPerf server does not start and gives an error in the form of "Access Denied", the user can resolve this error by running the command prompt as an administrator.

- When the twt application runs, SiWx91x scans and connect to the Wi-Fi access point and obtains an IP address. After a successful connection, the device connects to the tcp server socket and then sends the enable twt request API call. If TWT session setup is successful, the following notification will be printed with TWT Response parameters from the AP.
