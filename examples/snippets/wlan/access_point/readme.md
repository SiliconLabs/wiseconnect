## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect 3 extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-the-wi-se-connect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#connect-si-wx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware ](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#update-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project ](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#create-a-project)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- The application uses the default configurations as provided in the **default_wifi_ap_profile** in ``sl_net_default_values.h``. Users can choose to configure these parameters as needed.

- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the ``sl_net_default_values.h`` file. Configure the following parameters as you desire to enable the Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device as an access point.

- AP instance related parameters :

  - `DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID` refers to the SSID of the WiSeConnect soft AP that will be created.
 
    ```c
    #define DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID                   "MY_AP_SSID"     
    ```

  - `DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL` refers to the secret key of the WiSeConnect soft AP that will be created.

    ```c
    #define DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL                      "MY_AP_PASSPHRASE"
    ```

- Other AP instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_ap_profile` configuration structure.

> Note: 
> User can configure default region specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h`



## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.
- After the application gets executed successfully, the MAC addresses of the remote clients that get connected or disconnected to the newly created access point are printed on the console.
