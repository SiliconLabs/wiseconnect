# Access Point

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure the SiWx91x as a soft Access point and allows stations to connect to it.

## 2 Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

- A Windows PC.
- **SoC Mode**:
  - Silicon Labs [BRD4325A, BRD4325B, BRD4325C, BRD4325G, BRD4338A](https://www.silabs.com/)
- **NCP Mode**:
  - Silicon Labs [BRD4180B](https://www.silabs.com/) **AND**
  - Host MCU Eval Kit. This example has been tested with:
    - Silicon Labs [WSTK + EFR32MG21](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg21-bluetooth-starter-kit)

### 2.2 Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio IDE

  - Download the latest [Simplicity Studio IDE](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)
  - Follow the [Simplicity Studio user guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/1.1.0/ss-5-users-guide-getting-started/install-ss-5-and-software#install-ssv5) to install Simplicity Studio IDE

**NOTE**:

- The Host MCU platform (EFR32MG21) and the SiWx91x interact with each other through the SPI interface.

Follow the [Getting Started with Wiseconnect3 SDK](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) guide to set up the hardware connections and Simplicity Studio IDE.

## 3 Project Environment

- Ensure the SiWx91x loaded with the latest firmware following the [Upgrade Si91x firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-soc-mode#upgrade-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)

- Ensure the latest Gecko SDK along with the extension WiSeConnect3 is added to Simplicity Studio.

### 3.1 Creating the project

#### 3.1.1 SoC mode

- Ensure the SiWx91x set up is connected to your PC.

- In the Simplicity Studio IDE, the SiWx91x SoC board will be detected under **Debug Adapters** pane as shown below.

  **![Soc Board detection](resources/readme/soc_board_detection.png)**

#### 3.1.2 NCP mode

- Ensure the EFx32 and SiWx91x set up is connected to your PC.

- In the Simplicity Studio IDE, the EFR32 board will be detected under **Debug Adapters** pane as shown below.

### 3.2 Importing the project

- Studio should detect your board. Your board will be shown here. Click on the board detected and go to **EXAMPLE PROJECTS & DEMOS** section 

#### SOC Mode

- Select **Wi-Fi - Access Point(SOC)** test application

  **![project_selection](resources/readme/ap_example_soc.png)**

- Click 'Create'. The "New Project Wizard" window appears. Click 'Finish'

  **![creation_final](resources/readme/create_project.png)**

#### NCP Mode

- Select **Wi-Fi - Access Point(NCP)** test application

  **![project_selection](resources/readme/ap_example_ncp.png)**

- Click 'Create'. The "New Project Wizard" window appears. Click 'Finish'

### 3.3 Set up for application prints

#### 3.3.1 Teraterm set up - for BRD4325A, BRD4325B, BRD4325C, BRD4325G

You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.

1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

   - Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

   **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)**

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

   - Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

   **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)**

3. Open the Teraterm tool.

   - For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**.

     **![port_selection_soc](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

**Note:** For Other 917 SoC boards please refer section #3.3.2

#### 3.3.2 **Teraterm set up - for NCP and SoC modes**

1. Open the Teraterm tool.

- choose the J-Link port and click on **OK**.
    
    **![J-link - NCP](resources/readme/port_selection.png)**

2. Navigate to the Setup â†’ Serial port and update the baud rate to **115200** and click on **OK**.

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

### 4.1 Configure the application

- The application uses the default configurations as provided in the **default_wifi_ap_profile** in **sl_net_default_values.h** and user can choose to configure these parameters as needed.

**Note:** In the **Project Explorer** pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file.

### 4.2 Build the application

- SoC mode: Build as Access Point Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_accesspoint.png)**

- NCP mode: Build as Access Point Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_access_point_ncp.png)**

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

  - SoC

    **![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/program_device.png)**

  - NCP

    **![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/program_device_ncp.png)**

### 4.4 Application Output

- After the application gets executed successfully, the MAC addresses of the remote clients that gets connected or disconnected to the newly created Access point are printed on the console.

### Note

For NCP mode, following defines have to enabled manually in preprocessor setting of example project

- For 917A0 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1
- For 917B0 1.2 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1, CHIP_917B0 = 1
- For 917B0 2.0 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1, CHIP_917B0 = 1, SI917_RADIO_BOARD_V2 = 1 (This is enabled by default for all examples)
