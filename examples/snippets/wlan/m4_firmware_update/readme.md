## Purpose/Scope

This application shows how to update the M4 firmware of a device via Wi-Fi by downloading the firmware file from a remote TCP server. The server can be run on a local PC. Here's how the update process works:

- **Connection**: The device connects to a Wi-Fi network and acts as a TCP client.
- **Request**: The device sends a request to the TCP server for the firmware update file.
- **Download**: The server sends the firmware file to the device.
- **Update**: The device writes the new firmware to its memory and then restarts to complete the update.

This process allows the device to update its software over the air (OTA) without needing a physical connection.


## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements  

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs SiWx917 Evaluation Kit [WPK/WSTK + BRD4325A]
- Wireless Access Point
- Linux PC or Cygwin on Windows (to build and run the TCP server source provided)

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Linux Build Environment
  - Installation of Build tools for Linux including the gcc compiler (or equivalent on PC or Mac)
  - For Ubuntu, use the following command for installation: `user@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt install build-essential`
  - If you don't have Linux, [Cygwin for Windows](https://www.cygwin.com/) may be used instead
- VCOM Setup
  - The Docklight tool's setup instructions are provided below.

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

**STA instance related parameters**

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the Wi-Fi network shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
  ```

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
  ```

- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type of the access point. The supported security modes are mentioned in `sl_wifi_security_t`.

  ```c
  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE               SL_WIFI_WPA2 
  ```

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

> Note: 
> User can configure default region specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h`

**TCP Configuration**

- In the Project Explorer pane, open the **app.c** file. 

  ```c
  #define SERVER_PORT        5000             // TCP server port of the remote TCP server
  #define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "192.168.0.100"  // Server IP address 
  ```

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application
- Flash, run, and debug the application

To esstablish the TCP Server with firmware file on remote PC, follow the steps below:

 1. Copy the TCP server application [firmware_update_tcp_server_9117.c](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/examples/featured/firmware_update/firmware_update_tcp_server_9117.c) provided with the application source to a Linux PC connected to the Wi-Fi access point.
  2. Compile the application.

  > `user@linux:~$ gcc firmware_update_tcp_server.c` -o ota_server.bin

  3. Run the application providing the TCP port number (specified in the SiWx91x app) together with the firmware file and path.

  > `user@linux:~$ ./ota_server.bin 5000 wifi_access_point.rps`

... where **wifi_access_point.rps** is the firmware image to be sent to SiWx91x.
