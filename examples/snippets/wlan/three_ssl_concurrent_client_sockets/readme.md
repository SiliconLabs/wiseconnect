You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.

1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

   - Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

   **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)**

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

   - Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

   **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)**

3. Open the Teraterm tool.

   - For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**.

     **![port_selection_soc](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

**Note:** For Other 917 SoC boards please refer section #3.3.2

#### 3.3.2 **Teraterm set up - for NCP and SoC modes**

1. Open the Teraterm tool.

- choose the J-Link port and click on **OK**.

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment.
Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

### 4.1 Configure the application  

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

#### 4.1.1 In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network

**STA instance related parameters**

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
  	```

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  	```c 
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
  	```
  
	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE               SL_WIFI_WPA2 
  	```
  
- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

2. Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to test three_ssl_client_sockets app as per requirements  

```c
   #define SERVER_PORT1   <remote port>       // Remote server port
   #define SERVER_PORT2   <remote port>       // Remote server port cloud.
   #define SERVER_PORT3   <remote port>       //  remote peer/ which is running on cloud.   
   #define SERVER_ADDR    "192.168.1.108"     // Remote server IP address
```

If certificates are not there in flash, then ssl handshake will fail.
  
AWS_DOMAIN_NAME refers to domain name of the AWS server

```c
   #define AWS_DOMAIN_NAME   "a25jwtlmds8eip-ats.iot.us-east-2.amazonaws.com"
```

### 4.2 Build the application

Follow the below steps for the successful execution of the application.

- SoC mode: Build as  TLS Client Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_project.png)**

- NCP mode:

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

After making any custom configuration changes required, build, download and run the application as below.

- Copy the certificates server-cert and server-key into Openssl/bin folder in the Windows PC (Remote PC).

**Note!**
 > All the certificates are given in the SDK. Path: `<SDK>/resources/certificates`

- In Windows PC (Remote PC) which is connected to AP, run the Openssl server by giving the following command

```sh
    > Openssl.exe s_server -accept<SERVER_PORT> -cert <server_certificate_file_path> -key <server_key_file_path> -tls<tls_version>

   Example: openssl.exe s_server -accept 5001 -cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem -tls1
```

![Run the Openssl server](resources/readme/ssl_server.png)

- Make sure the SSL server is running in the cloud (check with the domain name)

- After the program gets executed, SiWx91x would be connected to Access point having the configuration same that of in the application and get IP.

- The Device which is configured as SSL client will connect to three different remote SSL servers.
