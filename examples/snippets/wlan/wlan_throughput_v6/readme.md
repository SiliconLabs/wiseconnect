# WLAN Throughput IPv6

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the procedure to measure WLAN UDP/TCP/TLS throughput by configuring the SiWx91x in client/server role using IPv6 addresses.
In this application, the SiWx91x connects to a Wi-Fi access point, obtains an IPv6 address, connects to Iperf server/client or python based TLS scripts, running on a remote PC and measures Tx/Rx throughput transmitted/received from remote PC.

### 4.1 Configure the Application

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

#### 4.1.1 In the Project explorer pane, expand the **resources\defaults** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network

- **STA instance related parameters**

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.
	
  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
  	```

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  	```c

    ```

- **Throughput Measurement Types**

  - The application may be configured to measure throughput using UDP, TCP or TLS packets. Choose the measurement type using the `THROUGHPUT_TYPE` macro.

    ```c
    #define THROUGHPUT_TYPE  TCP_TX     // Selects the throughput option
    #define TCP_TX           0   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TCP client
    #define TCP_RX           1   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote TCP server
    #define UDP_TX           2   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote UDP client
    #define UDP_RX           3   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote UDP server
    #define TLS_TX           4   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TLS server
    #define TLS_RX           5   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote TLS server
    ```

- **Throughput Test options**

    ```c
    #define BYTES_TO_SEND     (1 << 29)     // To measure TX throughput with 512MB data transfer

### 4.3 Testing Throughput steps at remote system

There are two 'ends' involved when measuring throughput, data is sent between the client end and the server end. By default, the Iperf protocol sends data from the client to the server to measure throughput. Depending on the configuration selected, the SiWx91x may be the client or the server. In general, it is advisable to start the server before the client since the client will immediately begin to try to connect to the server to send data.

The following sections describe how to run the SiWx91x throughput application together with examples for various Iperf configurations that run on the PC.

### UDP Tx Throughput

To measure UDP Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP client and start a UDP server on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the UDP server on the PC is:

> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -V -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -V -p 5001 -i 1`

### UDP Rx Throughput

To measure UDP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP server and start a UDP client on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the UDP client is:

> `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -V -u  -p <Module_Port> -i 1 -b <Bandwidth> -t <time interval in seconds> -l <UDP buffer length>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c 2001:db8:0:1::121 -V -u -p 5001 -i 1 -b 50M -t 30 -l 1450`

### TCP Tx Throughput

To measure TCP Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a TCP client and start a TCP server on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the TCP server is:
  
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -V -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -V -p 5001 -i 1`

### TCP Rx Throughput

To measure TCP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as TCP server and start a TCP client on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the TCP client is:

> `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -V -p <module_PORT> -i 1 -t <time interval in sec>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c 2001:db8:0:1::121 -V -p 5001 -i 1 -t 30`

### TLS Tx Throughput

To measure TLS Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a TLS client and start a TLS server on the remote PC as described below:

- Copy the `SSL_Server_throughput_v6.py` script from the release `/resources/scripts/` to the `/resources/certificates/` directory
- Open a command prompt and cd to the folder `/resources/certificates/`, then run the following command:
  - `C:\> python SSL_Server_throughput_v6.py`

> **Note:**
**The SSL_Server_throughput_v6.py script works only with Python version 2.**

## TLS Rx Throughput

To measure TLS RX throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a TLS client and open a TLS server on the remote PC as described below:

- Copy the `SSL_tx_throughput_v6.py` script from the release `/resources/scripts/` to the `/resources/certificates/` directory
- Open a command prompt and cd to the folder `/resources/certificates/`, then run the following command:
  - `C:\> python SSL_tx_throughput_v6.py`

> **Note:**
**The SSL_tx_throughput_v6.py script works only with Python version 2.**  

The SiWx91x, which is configured as a UDP/TCP/TLS server/client, connects to the iperf server/client and sends/receives data for configured intervals. While module is transmitting/receiving the data, application prints the throughput numbers in serial console.
