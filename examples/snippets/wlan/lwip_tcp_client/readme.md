## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

### Application Configuration Parameters

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.
- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the ``sl_net_default_values.h`` file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- STA instance related parameters

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.
 
   ```c
   #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
   ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

   ```c 
   #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
   ```
  
  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

   ```c
   #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE               SL_WIFI_WPA2 
   ```
  
- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

#### Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to test lwip app as per requirements

- **app related parameters**

  - `SERVER_PORT` is the remote TCP server port number on the PC running Iperf.

    ```c
    #define SERVER_PORT         5001
    ```

  - `SERVER_IP` is the remote TCP server IP address on the PC running Iperf. 

    ```c
    #define SERVER_IP   "192.168.0.247"
    ```

  - `NUMBER_OF_PACKETS` controls the number of packets sent to the remote TCP server. 

    ```c
    #define NUMBER_OF_PACKETS   1000
    ```

**Soc Mode**:

The M4 processor is set in sleep mode. The M4 processor can be woken in several ways as mentioned below:

- ALARM timer-based - In this method, an ALARM timer is run that wakes the M4 processor up periodically every **ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME** time period.
  - We can enable the ALARM timer-wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_ALARM_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.
  - In the Project explorer pane, expand as follows wiseconnect3_sdk_xxx > components > device > silabs > si91x > mcu > drivers > peripheral_drivers > src folder and open sl_si91x_m4_ps.c file. Configure **ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME**, in seconds, in sl_si91x_m4_ps.c
- Button press-based (GPIO) - In this method, the M4 processor wakes up upon pressing a button (BTN0).
  - We can enable the Button press-based wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_BUTTON_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.
- Wireless-based - When an RX packet is to be received by the TA, the M4 processor is woken up.
  - We can enable the Wireless-wakeup by adding the preprocessor macro "SL_SI91X_MCU_WIRELESS_BASED_WAKEUP" for the example.

### Note
  - Enable `SL_SI91X_TCP_IP_FEAT_BYPASS` bitmap in tcp_ip_feature_bitmap to use the lwip stack.
  - Refer [sl_net_init()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-nwk-mgmt/net-interface-functions#sl-net-init) API for using the lwip stack.

## Test the application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.
- After the application gets executed successfully, The device will connect to the remote and transfer the 1000 tcp packets.
