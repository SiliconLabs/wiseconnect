## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

- Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to test rf_test app as per requirements

```c
  sl_wifi_data_rate_t rate = SL_WIFI_DATA_RATE_6;
  sl_si91x_request_tx_test_info_t tx_test_info = {
  .enable    = 1,    // Enable/disable tx test mode
    .power   = 4,    // Tx RF power in the range [2:18] dBm
    .rate    = rate, // WLAN data rate of 6Mbps
    .length  = 30,   // Tx packet length in the range [24:1500] bytes in burst mode,
    .mode    = 0,    // Selects burst mode or continuous mode
    .channel = 1,    // Channel number in 2.4 or 5 GHz
  // Other configurable parameters
  }
```

    The different values of mode:
      0 - Burst Mode
      1 - Continuous Mode
      2 - Continuous wave Mode (non modulation) in DC mode
      3 - Continuous wave Mode (non modulation) in single tone mode (center frequency -2.5MHz)
      4 - Continuous wave Mode (non modulation) in single tone mode (center frequency +5MHz)

  Receive stats pre-processor macro:

#define RECEIVE_STATS           0 // Enable/Disable receive stats testing
#define MAX_RECEIVE_STATS_COUNT 5 // Number of iterations for which the receive stats would be displayed

**NOTE**:
    Receive stats testing should be done in a controlled environment (RF shield box or chamber).

- In app.c file change the region_code to the respective region in transmit_test_configuration.

        region_code - US, EU, JP, WORLD_DOMAIN, KR

        Supported Channels in the specific regions
        US           -     1-11
        EUROPE       -     1-13
        JAPAN        -     1-14
        WORLD_DOMAIN -     1-14
        KOREA        -     1-13

    Note: Currently SG region is not supported.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application

  - Application prints

  ![Figure: Application prints ](resources/readme/application_prints_soc_ncp.png)

Follow the steps below for successful execution of the application:

### Transmit Spectrum Example

```c
  sl_wifi_data_rate_t rate = SL_WIFI_DATA_RATE_6;
  sl_si91x_request_tx_test_info_t tx_test_info = {
  .enable = 1, .power = 127, .rate = rate, .length = 100,
  .mode      = 1, // Continuous Mode
    .channel = 6,
  // Other configurable parameters
  }                  
```

The below result is for PER Mode with Channel '6' with 6 Mbps data rate and max 127 power index, in Continuous mode, OFDM modulation technique.

    NOTE:
    A) Receive stats testing should be done in a controlled environment (RF shield box or chamber).

### RF Test with wifi 6

- Configure the following parameters in **app.c** to perform rf_test with wifi 6 as per requirements

```c
  sl_wifi_data_rate_t rate = SL_WIFI_DATA_RATE_MCS0;
  sl_si91x_request_tx_test_info_t tx_test_info = {
    .enable      = 1,
    .power       = 127,
    .rate        = rate,
    .length      = 100,
    .mode        = 1,     // Continuous Mode
    .channel     = 1,
    .aggr_enable = 0,
#ifdef SLI_SI917
    .enable_11ax            = 1, // 11AX_ENABLE 0-disable, 1-enable
    ....
// Other configurable parameters
// The description of the configurable parameters can be found in sl_si91x_request_tx_test_info_t structure
#endif
  }

  osDelay(100000); //add delay as per the requirement
```

- Configure below parameter in **app.c** to enable AGGREGATION support
  .feature_bit_map = SL_SI91X_FEAT_AGGREGATION

The below is the result for PER Mode with Channel '1' with MCS index 0 transfer rate, in continuous mode.
