# User Gain Table

## 1 Purpose/Scope
While measuring the performance of 802.11 Wireless Devices, packet error test has become an integral part for FCC certification. This application explains users how to start transmission in Burst mode with different data rates, transmit power and lengths with user gain table values.

## 2 Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC.
- Spectrum Analyzer and UFL connector
- SiWx91x Wi-Fi Evaluation Kit
  - **SoC Mode**:
    - Silicon Labs [BRD4325A, BRD4325B, BRD4325C, BRD4325G, BRD4388A](https://www.silabs.com/)
  - **NCP Mode**:
    - Silicon Labs [BRD4180B](https://www.silabs.com/)
    - Host MCU Eval Kit. This example has been tested with:
      - Silicon Labs [WSTK + EFR32MG21](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg21-bluetooth-starter-kit)
    - Spectrum Analyzer

### 2.2 Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio IDE

    - Download the latest [Simplicity Studio IDE](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)
    - Follow the [Simplicity Studio user guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/1.1.0/ss-5-users-guide-getting-started/install-ss-5-and-software#install-ssv5) to install Simplicity Studio IDE

### 2.3 Setup Diagram

#### NCP Mode
![Figure: Setup Diagram NCP Mode for User Gain Table Example](resources/readme/image217ncp.PNG)

Follow the [Getting Started with Wiseconnect3 SDK](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) guide to set up the hardware connections and Simplicity Studio IDE.

**NOTE:**
By default, The radio is mapped to internal antenna path. To perform RF measurements, the signal path has to be shifted towards the U.FL port.
To change the signal path, the following hardware changes are required (for both SoC and NCP modes) -

1) Unmount C24
2) Mount R22

This hardware change is required only for the Transmit Performance and Regulatory Testing example. While testing the other applications, the hardware changes have to be reverted (Mount C24 and Unmount R22) for the board to function normally.

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.


1. In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

- **STA instance related parameters**

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.
  
     ```c
     #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
     ```````

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

     ```c

### 4.2 Build the application

- SoC mode: Build as User Gain Table Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_user_gain_table.png)**

- NCP mode: Build as User Gain Table Example

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_project_ncp.png)** 

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

  - SoC

    **![debug_mode_SoC](resources/readme/program_device.png)**

  - NCP

    **![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/program_device_ncp.png)**

- As soon as the debug process is completed, the application control branches to the main().

- Click on the **Resume** icon in the Simplicity Studio IDE toolbar to run the application.

**![Run](resources/readme/run.png)**

When the application runs, the SiWx91x starts transmitting using the configuration settings. A power meter or spectrum analyzer may be used to monitor the RF output power and spectrum.

The following readme provides example spectrums when the SiWx91x is configured to transmit with the settings shown.

## Transmit Spectrum Example 
```c
  sl_wifi_data_rate_t rate = SL_WIFI_DATA_RATE_6; // For 6 Mbps data rate
  #define SL_TX_TEST_POWER    127                   
  #define SL_TX_TEST_RATE     rate                      
  #define SL_TX_TEST_LENGTH   100                   
  #define SL_TX_TEST_MODE     0 // 0 for Burst Mode  
  #define SL_TX_TEST_CHANNEL  6                     
```
The below result is for PER Mode with Channel '6' with 6 Mbps data rate and max 127 power index, in Burst mode, OFDM modulation technique.
