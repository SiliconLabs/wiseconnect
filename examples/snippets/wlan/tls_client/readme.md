## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to open a TCP client socket on SiWx917 module and use this TCP client socket with a secure connection using SSL and transmit data over the socket.

- Two TCP sockets are opened over SSL. One socket uses SSL TLS v1.0 protocol and the other socket uses SSL TLS v1.2 protocol.
- CA certificate and device certificates are loaded into module flash, as they are necessary for the key exchanges involved while using SSL.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

- The application uses the default configurations as provided in the **default_wifi_ap_profile** in ``sl_net_default_values.h`` and user can choose to configure these parameters as needed.
- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.

  - STA instance related parameters

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
      ```

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
      ```

    - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type if the Access point is configured in WPA/WPA2 or mixed security modes.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE              SL_WIFI_WPA2 
      ```
  
  - Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

> Note: 
> Users can configure default region-specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h`

  - Configure the following parameters in ``app.c`` to test tls client app as per requirements

  - Client/Server IP Settings

    ```c
    #define SERVER_PORT1        <remote_port>      // Remote server port
    #define SERVER_PORT2        <remote_port>      // Remote server port
    #define SERVER_IP          "192.168.0.100"     // Remote server IP address
    ```

- `sl_wifi_device_configuration_t` from `app.c` should be modified as per below requirements

  **[sl_net_set_credential()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.0.13/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-nwk-mgmt/net-credential-functions#sl-net-set-credential)** API expects the certificate in the form of linear array. Convert the pem certificate into linear array form using python script provided in the SDK `<SDK>/resources/scripts/certificate_script.py`.

   For example : If the certificate is ca-certificate.pem, enter the command in the following way:
   python certificate_script.py ca-certificate.pem 
   The script will generate ca-certificate.pem in which one linear array named ca-certificate contains the certificate.

  Root CA certificate needs to be converted as mentioned above.

  After the conversion, place the converted file in `<SDK>/resources/certificates/` path and include the certificate file in app.c

  ```c
  // Certificate includes
  #include "ca-certificate.pem.h"
  
  // Load Security Certificates
  status = sl_net_set_credential(SL_NET_TLS_SERVER_CREDENTIAL_ID(0), SL_NET_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE, ca-certificate, sizeof(ca-certificate) - 1);
  ```

> **Note** :
 The included self-signed certificates will work for local OpenSSL server. For cloud servers, using default certificates for a cloud connection does not work. Replace the default certificates with valid certificates when connecting to Cloud Server.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application
- Flash, run and debug the application

  ![TLS Client_Output](resources/readme/tls_client_output.png)

- After making any custom configuration changes required, build, download and run the application as below.
- Copy the certificates server-cert and server-key into Openssl/bin folder in the Windows PC2 (Remote PC).
- In Windows PC2 (Remote PC) which is connected to AP, run the Openssl and run two SSL servers by giving the following command:

  ```sh
      > Openssl.exe s_server -accept<SERVER_PORT> -cert <server_certificate_file_path> -key <server_key_file_path> -tls<tls_version>

      Example:
      > openssl.exe s_server -accept 5002 -cert server-cert.pem -key server-key.pem -tls1
  ```

- After the program gets executed, SiWx91x EVK would be connected to access point having the configuration same as that of in the application and get IP.
- The SiWx91x EVK which is configured as SSL client will connect to remote SSL server and sends number of packets configured in NUMBER_OF_PACKETS.

- EVK connects to remote SSL server-1

- EVK connects to remote SSL server-2
