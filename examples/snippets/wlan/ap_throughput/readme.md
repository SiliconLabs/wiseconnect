## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the procedure to measure WLAN UDP/TCP/TLS throughput by configuring the SiWx91x Soft Access Point in Client/Server role.
The SiWx91x as a Soft Access Point allows stations to connect and later get connected to an iPerf Server/Client or Python-based TLS scripts running on a remote PC. The SiWx91x then measures throughput for transmitted/received data from the remote PC.

  - Update the device's connectivity firmware as mentioned [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-ncp-mode).
  - Connect the SiWx91x NCP to STM32F411RE Nucleo Board following the below steps:
   	- Connect the male Arduino compatible header on carrier board to female Arduino compatible header on STM32F411RE Nucleo board.
   	- Mount the NCP radio board (BRD4346A/BRD4357A) onto the radio board socket available on the base board (BRD8045C).
   	- After connecting all the boards, the setup should look like the image shown below:
    ![Figure: Setup](resources/readme/stm32_setup.png)
   	- Connect the setup to the computer.
  - Open the FIRMWARE UPDATE µVision project - **ap_throughput.uvprojx** by navigating to **WiSeConnect 3 SDK → examples → snippets → wlan → ap_throughput → keil_project**. 

## Application Build Environment
The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to act as a soft access point.

- AP instance related parameters:

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID refers to the SSID of the WiSeConnect softAP that would be created.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_PROFILE_SSID                   "MY_AP_SSID"
  	```

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key of the WiSeConnect softAP that would be created.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_AP_CREDENTIAL                     "MY_AP_PASSPHRASE"
    ```
> Note: 
> You can configure default region-specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h`.


- Configure the following parameters in `app.c` to test throughput app as per requirements:

  - Client/Server IP Settings

      ```c
      #define LISTENING_PORT     <local_port>       // Local port to use
      #define SERVER_PORT        <remote_port>      // Remote server port
      #define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "192.168.10.11"    // Remote server IP address
      #define SOCKET_ASYNC_FEATURE 1                // Type of Socket used. Synchronous = 0, Asynchronous = 1
      ```

- Throughput Measurement Types

    - The application may be configured to measure throughput using UDP, TCP, or TLS packets. Choose the measurement type using the `THROUGHPUT_TYPE` macro.

      ```c
      #define THROUGHPUT_TYPE  TCP_TX     // Selects the throughput option

      #define TCP_TX           0   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TCP client
      #define TCP_RX           1   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote TCP server
      #define UDP_TX           2   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote UDP client
      #define UDP_RX           3   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote UDP server
      #define TLS_TX           4   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TLS server
      #define TLS_RX           5   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote TLS server
      ```

  - Throughput Test options

      ```c
      #define BYTES_TO_SEND     (1 << 29)     // To measure TX throughput with 512 MB data transfer
      #define BYTES_TO_RECEIVE  (1 << 20)     // To measure RX throughput with 1 MB data transfer
      #define TEST_TIMEOUT      10000         // Throughput test timeout in ms
      ```
 
  - Configure the TCP RX window size and TCP RX window division factor to 44 in the socket configuration in **app.c** to achieve high throughput for TCP_RX and TLS_RX.
   
    ```c
    static sl_si91x_socket_config_t socket_config = {
      1,  // Total sockets
      1,  // Total TCP sockets
      0,  // Total UDP sockets
      0,  // TCP TX only sockets
      1,  // TCP RX only sockets
      0,  // UDP TX only sockets
      0,  // UDP RX only sockets
      1,  // TCP RX high performance sockets
      44, // TCP RX window size
      44  // TCP RX window division factor
    };
    ```  
### Test the application

### Instructions for Simplicity Studio IDE and Silicon Labs Devices (SoC and NCP Modes)

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/5.8.2/ss-5-users-guide-building-and-flashing/building) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.

  > **Note:** AP standalone mode does not support Tx aggregation. Rx aggregation is supported with block acknowledgment (Block Ack) sessions. This constraint will impact throughput, particularly in scenarios other than UDP Rx.

### Instructions for Keil IDE and STM32F411RE MCU

- Build the application.
- Set the Docklight up by connecting STM32's Serial COM port. This enables you to view the application prints.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.

  > **Note:** The SiWx91x, which is configured as a UDP/TCP/TLS server/client, connects to the iPerf server/client and sends/receives data for configured intervals. While the module is transmitting/receiving the data, the application prints the throughput numbers in the serial console.

#### Run the UDP Server

##### UDP Tx Throughput

To measure UDP Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP client and start a UDP server on the remote PC. To establish UDP server on the remote PC, open [iPerf Application](https://sourceforge.net/projects/iperf2/files/iperf-2.0.8-win.zip/download) and run the below command from the downloaded folder's path in the command prompt.
The iPerf command to start the UDP server on the PC is:

  > `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
  >
  > For example ...
  >
  > `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -p 5000 -i 1`

  ![Figure: UDP_TX](resources/readme/UDP_TX.png)

##### UDP Rx Throughput

To measure UDP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP server and start a UDP client on the remote PC.
The iPerf command to start the UDP client is:

  > `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -u -p <Module_Port> -i 1 -b <Bandwidth> -t <time interval in seconds>`
  >
  > For example ...
  >
  > `C:\> iperf.exe -c 192.168.10.10 -u -p 5005 -i 1 -b70M -t 30`

  ![Figure: TCP_RX](resources/readme/TCP_RX.png)

##### TLS Tx Throughput

To measure TLS Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a TLS client and start a TLS server on the remote PC as described in the following bullets:

- Copy the `SSL_Server_throughput_d.py` script from the release `/resources/scripts/` directory to the `/resources/certificates/` directory.
- Open a command prompt and cd to the folder `/resources/certificates/`, then run the following command:
  - `C:\> python SSL_Server_throughput_d.py`

    > **Note:** The SSL_Server_throughput_d.py script works only with Python version 2 and above.

    >   The TLSv1_3 works for Python version greater than 3.6.
