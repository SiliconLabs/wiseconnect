## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure SiWx91x module as a GATT server with heart rate service in BLE peripheral mode and explains how to indicate operations with the GATT server from a connected remote device using the GATT client.

Also configure SiWx91x module as a GATT client in BLE central mode and enable indication of operation of the heart rate service of the connected remote GATT server from the GATT client. In the application,heart rate GATT server is configured with heart rate services and their corresponding characteristic UUIDs.

When the connected remote device writes data to writable characteristic UUID, the WiseConnect device receives the data that is received on writable characteristic UUID, writes the same data to readable characteristic UUID and sends indications to the connected device (or) remote device that can read the same data using read characteristic UUID if indication enabled on client side.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application in Studio.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps below for successful execution of the application:

### Verify BLE Heart Rate Profile Application as a Server

1. After the program gets executed, if Silicon Labs device is configured as ``SERVER`` specified in the macro ``GATT_ROLE``, Silicon Labs device will be in Advertising state.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. Open a EFR Connect App in the Smartphone and do the scan.

4. In the App, Silicon Labs module device will appear with the name configured in the macro `RSI_BLE_HEART_RATE_PROFILE (Ex: "BLE_HEART_RATE")` or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "**SimpleBLEPeripheral**".

    ![](resources/readme/bleheartratedeviceadvertising.png)

5. Initiate connection from the App.

6. After successful connection, EFR Connect APP displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.

    ![](resources/readme/bleheartratedeviceconnected.png)

7. Select the attribute service which is added `RSI_BLE_HEART_RATE_SERVICE_UUID`

8. Enable notify for the characteristic `RSI_BLE_HEART_RATE_MEASUREMENT_UUID`, so that GATT server indicates when value updated in that particular attribute.

    ![](resources/readme/bleheartratedevicegattservernotificationsenabled.png)

9. Whenever the value is updated at server, it will be notified to the client which can be read at `Heart_Rate_Measurement` attribute.

    ![](resources/readme/bleheartratedevicegattserverreceiveddata.png)

### Verify BLE Heart Rate Profile Application as a Client

1. Configure the **GATT_ROLE** macro as **CLIENT**

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. Open the EFR Connect APP and Create the **Heart rate service** to configure the Remote device as a GATT server.
   - Name: Heart Rate
   - UUID: 0x180D

   > **Note:** Refer the [Adding Services](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for creating the GATT server the EFR connect mobile APP as advertiser.

   ![](resources/readme/gattconfigurator1.png)

4. Add the characteristic services and their coresponding properties as shown below:
   | S.No | Name | UUID | Property |
   |------|------|------|----------|
   |1|Heart Rate Measurement | 0x2A37 | Notify|
   |2|Body sensor Location | 0x2A38 | Read|
   |3|Heart Rate Control Point | 0x2A39 | Write|

   > **Note:** Refer the [Adding Characteristics and Descriptors](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for creating the GATT server in the EFR connect mobile APP.

   ![](resources/readme/gattconfigurator2.png)

5. Enable the **Heart rate** service.

    ![](resources/readme/gattconfigurator3.png)

6. Configure the advertiser.

    ![](resources/readme/bleheartrateadvertiser.png)   

    > **Note:** Refer the [Creating New Advertisement Sets](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for configuring the EFR connect mobile APP as advertiser.

7. When Silicon Labs device is configured as **CLIENT** specified in the macro ``GATT_ROLE``, scans for remote device and tries to connect with the remote device specified in `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR or RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME` macro.

8. Get all GATT profiles of remote device and Search for profile specified in the macro `RSI_BLE_HEART_RATE_SERVICE_UUID`. And get all characteristics of the heart rate service and verify the characteristic `RSI_BLE_HEART_RATE_MEASUREMENT_UUID` which has notify property.

9. Observe notify property is enabled in the GATT server and indicates to the GATT client whenever the value is updated at server.

10. Observe the updated heart rate measurement value on the teraterm. Refer the below images for console prints:
