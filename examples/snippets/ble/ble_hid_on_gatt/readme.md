## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure SiWx91x EVK as GATT a server in BLE peripheral mode and as a GATT client in BLE central mode, and provides details of how to do read, notify and indicate operations with the GATT server from connected remote device using the GATT client and details of getting GATT information from remote GATT server in case of our module as client.

HID (Human Interface Device) service GATT server configured with an HID service with notification characteristic UUID. When a connected remote device writes data to writable characteristic UUID, module receives the data which is received on writable characteristic UUID and writes the same data to readable characteristic UUID and sends notifications to the connected device (or) remote device can read the same data using read characteristic UUID if notification enabled on client side.

HID service GATT client will get HID service (primary service) , Report Map (characteristic service), and descriptors(client characteristic configuration and report reference) information from the remote GATT server. If remote device supports notify, our module will enable notify property and will be notified by the remote GATT server when value changed.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

  - Build the application in Studio.
  - Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:

### Server Role

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in advertising state.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. Open a default bluetooth settings and do the scan.

4. In the App, Silicon Labs module will appear with the name configured in the macro **RSI_BLE_APP_HIDS (Ex: "HID_OVER_GATT")** or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "**SimpleBLEPeripheral**".

    ![ble_hid_advertising](resources/readme/blehidadvertising.png)

5. Initiate connection from the bluetooth settings. It automatically redirects to the pin-code entry pop-up window.

    ![ble_hid_pairing](resources/readme/blehidpairing.png)

6. Enter the **Pin code** which is displayed in the serial terminal.

7. While connection, smart phone will do service discovery and it will find the HID service with UUID **RSI_BLE_HID_SERVICE_UUID.** After that it will read report map and enables the notification.

8. After successful connection, open note pad or any text editor in phone, you can see some text printing.

    ![ble_hid_connection](resources/readme/blehidconnection.png)

9. By default, the application is sending some text (i.e., "hog") in regular intervals, which will come as a notification to a smart phone. Use notepad or chrome to observe the received data.

### Client Role

1. Advertise a LE device which supports Human Interface Device service.

2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will connect to that remote device based on given BD address.

3. After successful connection Silicon Labs module will read the services from the remote GATT server.

4. If remote device support notify property Silicon Labs module will enable notify, and ready to receive notifications from remote device.

5. Whenever GATT server changes value and notifies that Silicon Labs module will receive that value.
