## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:

1. Set the desired name Silicon Labs device needs to advertise in `RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME` and its random address in `RSI_BLE_SET_RAND_ADDR`. User needs to populate `RSI_BLE_ADV_INT_MIN` and `RSI_BLE_ADV_INT_MAX` with desired values for minimum advertsing interval and maximum advertsing interval.

2. After the program gets executed, from remote device scan for Silicon Labs device which advertsises with the remote device specified in `RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME` macro.

3. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and SiWx91x. 

   > **Note:** Examples for BLE peripherals: Bluetooth Dongle, mobile application, TA sensor tag.
   
4. After successful program execution the prints looks as shown following.
