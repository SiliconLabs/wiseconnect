### 2.4 iBeacon details

**iBeacon Advertise Data Format**

  iBeacon prefix   UUID        Major Number   Minor Number    TX Power
  9Bytes           16bytes     2Bytes         2 Bytes         1bytes

   **iBeacon Prefix:**
   Vendor specific fixed value.
   Default iBeacon prefix values setting by application is,
   Prefix = {0x02, 0x01, 0x02, 0x1A, 0xFF, 0x4C, 0x00, 0x02, 0x15}

   **UUID:**
   User generated proximity UUID.
   Remote devices recognize which beacon they approach on the basis of UUID, major and minor numbers.
   Default UUID, Major and Minor values setting by application is,
   UUID = {0xFB , 0x0B , 0x57 , 0xA2 , 0x82 , 0x28 , 0x44 , 0xCD , 0x91 ,
   0x3A , 0x94 , 0xA1 , 0x22 , 0xBA , 0x12 , 0x06}
   major_num = {0x11, 0x22}
   minor_num = {0x33, 0x44}

   **TX Power** is used to calculate distance from iBeacon.
   Default TX power value setting by application is,
   TX Power = 0x33

  Note:
  If the user wants to change the prefix, UUID, Major number, Minor number and TX Power values, change the following values in rsi_ble_ibeacon.c_ file.

   For Prefix:
   `<span style="color: #005032">uint8_t</span> adv[31] = {0x02, 0x01, 0x02, 0x1A, 0xFF, 0x4C, 0x00, 0x02, 0x15}; //prefix(9bytes)`

   **For UUID:**

   uint8_t uuid[16] = {0xFB , 0x0B , 0x57 , 0xA2 , 0x82 , 0x28 , 0x44 , 0xCD , 0x91 , 0x3A , 0x94 , 0xA1 , 0x22 , 0xBA , 0x12 , 0x06};

- For Major Number:
  - uint8_t major_num[2] = {0x11, 0x22};

- For Minor Number:
  - uint8_t minor_num[2] = {0x33, 0x44};

- For TX Power:
  - uint8_t tx_power = 0x33;
