## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to modify gain table offset/max power details. The app can be used to overwrite the default region based gain table with a user-defined region-based gain table.

There are two types of gain tables for BLE protocol
  - Gain table holding maximum transmit power values
  - Gain table with maximum power vs. offset values

Both gain tables must be configured in the correct order to successfully apply changes in the firmware.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.


   The API used to update the gain table is:
```c
int32_t rsi_bt_cmd_update_gain_table_offset_or_max_pwr(uint8_t node_id,
                                                       uint8_t payload_len,
                                                       uint8_t *payload,
                                                       uint8_t req_type)
```
---
**Note!**
* This command must be used immediately after opermode request
* Internally, the firmware maintains two tables
    * Gain table holding Max Tx power values for all regions
    * Gain table with Max power vs offset values for each channel of all regions
* There are 5 regions supported and are FCC, ETSI, TELEC, KCC, WORLDWIDE. These FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC gain table max power level and offset values should be loaded in end-to-end mode via BLE User Gain table. This has to be called upon every boot-up since this information is not saved inside flash. SoC uses these tables in FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC to limit power and not to violate allowed limits.
* For Worldwide region firmware uses Worldwide values for Tx. For other regions(FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC), Firmware uses min value out of Worldwide & Region based values for Tx.  Also there will be part to part variation across chips and offsets are estimated during manufacturing flow which will be applied as correction factor during normal mode of operation.
* This frame has to be used by customers who has done FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC certification with their own antenna. All other customers should not use this. Inappropriate use of this frame may result in violation of FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC or any certifications and Silicon labs is not liable for that.

* BLE power offset like <CHANNEL_NUM>, <1M_OFFSET>, <2M_OFFSET>, <500kbps_oFFSET>, <125kbps_oFFSET>

Set below macro to update Max TX power and offset
```c
#define GAIN_TABLE_AND_MAX_POWER_UPDATE_ENABLE 1 //! To update gain table and max tx power and offsets
```

**req_type** can be set to one of the following macros :
```c
#define UPDATE_GAIN_TABLE_MAX_POWER 0  // For updating Gain table Max power
#define UPDATE_GAIN_TABLE_OFFSET    1  // For updating Gain table offset
#define BLE_GAIN_TABLE_LP_CHAIN_0DBM_OFFSET_UPDATE  2
#define BLE_GAIN_TABLE_LP_CHAIN_10DBM_OFFSET_UPDATE 3
```
**node_id** refers to BLE Node id :
```c
#define BLE_NODE 0  // For selecting BLE node
```

The following arrays will be used to update_gain_table based on `node_id` and `req_type`.

| `node_id`  | `req_type`                    | Payload Array                                    |

| `BLE_NODE` | `UPDATE_GAIN_TABLE_MAX_POWER` | `Si917_BLE_REGION_BASED_MAXPOWER_XX`           |
| `BLE_NODE` | `UPDATE_GAIN_TABLE_OFFSET`    | `Si917_BLE_REGION_BASED_MAXPOWER_VS_OFFSET_XX` |
| `BLE_NODE` | `BLE_GAIN_TABLE_LP_CHAIN_0DBM_OFFSET_UPDATE` | `Si917_BLE_REGION_BASED_LP_CHAIN_0DBM_OFFSET_XX`           |
| `BLE_NODE` | `BLE_GAIN_TABLE_LP_CHAIN_10DBM_OFFSET_UPDATE`    | `Si917_BLE_REGION_BASED_LP_CHAIN_10DBM_OFFSET_XX` |

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application in Studio.
- Flash, run and debug the application

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:

1. As soon as the debug process is completed, the application control branches to the main().

2. Go to the J-link Silicon Labs console pane to observe the debug prints in the Serial 1 tab.

3. Click on the **Resume** icon in the Simplicity Studio IDE toolbar to run the application.

4. Review gain table updates on the serial terminal. Refer the following image for console prints:
