## Purpose/Scope

The application demonstrates how to configure SiWx91x EVK in central/peripheral modes and then connect with multiple peripherals/centrals.

It provides user to configure secure connection with central and peripheral remote devices and support data transfers.

This also displays all the remote GATT profiles and service characteristics logs of connected remote device.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application in Studio.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps below for the successful execution of the program:

1. Configure the remote ble devices in peripheral and put it in advertising mode and/or in central and put in scanning mode.

   > **Note:** Refer the [Creating New Advertisement Sets](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for configuring the Simplicity Connect mobile App(formerly EFR Connect App) connect mobile APP as advertiser.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. Silicon Labs device is configured as GATT server with the below user-defined services.

   | S.No |UUID size |main service UUID | Characteristic service UUID | Property|
   |------|---|------|------|-----|
   |1|16-bit|0xAABB | 0x1AA1 | Read, Write & Notify|
   |2|128-bit|0x6A4E3304-667B-11E3-949A-0800200C9A66 | 0x6A4E3304-667B-11E3-949A-0800200C9A66 | Write with no response|
   |3|16-bit| 0x1AA1|0x1BB1 | Read & indicate|

4. Silicon Labs device is in scanning and advertising mode.

5. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs device tries to connect with the remote device name specified in
   the macro **RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAMEX** or **RSI_BLE_DEV_X_ADDR**. X could be 1,2 or 3.

6. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and Silicon Labs device.

7. When the connection is established with the remote device, the Silicon Labs device fetch the GATT profiles and characteristics and also prints the same on the serial terminal.

8. If user configures SMP pairing in the specified macro **SMP_ENABLE_XX**, after successful connection between Silicon Labs device and remote device flow of commands are as below:

   a. Central device will initiate SMP pairing.
  
   b. Peripheral device gives SMP response.

   c. Based on the configured IO capability, the Silicon Labs device tries to establish the SMP connection.

9. When the SMP connection is established successfully, the host receives an SMP encrypt enabled event. If not, Silicon Labs Device sends an SMP failure event to the host.

10. When the Silicon Labs device as a central device, it initiates the scanning and tries to connects to a **remote BLE peripheral device**, which are specified in the `RSI_BLE_DEV_X_ADDR` or `RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAMEX` macros. After the successful connection, the Silicon Labs device initiates the SMP connection too.

11. When the Silicon Labs device as a Peripheral device, it initiates the advertising. The **remote BLE peripheral device** requires to do a scan and initiates the connection. Once the connection is successful, the Silicon Labs device initiates the SMP pairing.

12. To check data transfer, enable Gatt notifications of Silicon Labs device on service characteristic having UUID 0x1AA1, where the Silicon Lab device as a peripheral device.

13. If enabled, Silicon Labs device continuously transmits notifications which can be seen on remote device.
