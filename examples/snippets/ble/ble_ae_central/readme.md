## Test the Application

### Instructions for Simplicity Studio IDE and Silicon Labs devices (SoC and NCP Modes)
Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application
- Flash, run and debug the application

### Instructions for Keil IDE and STM32F411RE MCU

- Build the application.
- Set the Docklight up by connecting STM32's Serial COM port. This enables you to view the application prints.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:

1. Configure the remote BLE device in peripheral mode, add the complete local name record, enable the scan response data, and connectable options to the advertising data. And keep it in the advertising mode. Ensure that the specified remote device name in the RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME macro is proper.

   > **Note:** 
   > - Refer the [Creating New Advertisement Sets](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for configuring the Simplicity Connect mobile App(formerly EFR Connect App) as advertiser. 
   > - The provided mobile screenshots are from the 2.8.1 version of the Simplicity Connect App(formerly EFR Connect App), it is recommended to use the latest version. 
2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs device tries to connect with the remote device specified in `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR` or `RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME` macro.
3. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and SiWx91x module.
