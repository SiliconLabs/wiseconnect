# BLE Privacy

## 1. Purpose / Scope

Bluetooth LE supports a feature that reduces the ability to track an LE device over a period of time by changing the Bluetooth device address on a frequent basis, called Privacy of that particular device.

The device address of the remote device referred to as the private address will be resolved by local device in order to connect to that device. The private address is generated by using Identity Resolving Key (IRK) exchange in between devices during SMP bonding procedure. Our local device will add the remote devices in one Resolving list(to maintain remote device identity addresses) along with that IRK's and enable the Resolution, sets privacy mode and connect to the remote device with remote identity address.

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

   ![](resources/readme/load_image2.png)

### 5.3 Steps to be followed to verify BLE Privacy application as a SLAVE

1. If Silicon Labs device is configured as "PERIPHERAL_ROLE " specified in the macro RSI_DEVICE_ROLE, Silicon Labs device will be in the Advertising state.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. Open a LE App in the Smartphone and do the scan.

4. In the App, Silicon Labs device device will appear with the name configured in the macro `RSI_BLE_DEVICE_NAME`.

   ![](resources/readme/ble_slave1.png)

5. Initiate a connection from the App by clicks on the **Connect** button

6. After a successful connection, the Silicon labs device initiates the **SMP** request.

7. The remote device receives the **pair** pop-up window, Once the user clicks on the **pair** button the Silicon Labs device receives the passkey.

   ![](resources/readme/ble_slave2.png)

8. Again the remote device receives the **pair** pop-up window, and click on the **pair**  button. Enter the received passkey as shown below.

   ![](resources/readme/ble_slave3.png)

9. After successful SMP connection security keys will exchange  between the Remote device and Silicon Labs device.

10. Silicon Labs device will add the remote device's IRK's and local IRK's in to resolve list and enable resolution

   ![](resources/readme/ble_slave4.png)

11. Give disconnect from remote device and the Silicon labs device starts advertising

### 5.4 Steps to be followed to verify BLE Privacy application as a MASTER

1. If Silicon Labs device is configured as **CENTRAL_ROLE** specified in the macro **RSI_DEVICE_ROLE**, Silicon Labs device will be in Scanning state.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. Advertise the remote device.
**Note:** Refer the [Creating New Advertisement Sets](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for configuring the EFR connect mobile APP as advertiser.

4. If Silicon Labs device get device with name configured `RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME` or bd address with address configured in RSI_BLE_REMOTE_ADDR in results ,local device will try to connect with remote device.

5. After connection Silicon Labs device which is in central mode will initiate an SMP request.  

6. Give a response from Remote device and passkey

7. After a successful SMP connection security keys will exchanged between Remote device and Silicon Labs device and the Silicon Labs device will add remote device's IRK's and local IRK's in to resolve list and enable resolution

8. Give disconnect from remote device and keep in advertise mode.

9. Now Silicon Labs device will try to connect to remote device with identity address.

10. After successful connection, Silicon Labs device will give start encryption instead of SMP repairing.

11. Encryption will be enabled on both sides.
