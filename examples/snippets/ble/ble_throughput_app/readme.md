# BLE Throughput App

## 1 Purpose / Scope

This application demonstrates how to exchange continuous data to the remote device to measure the On-Air Throughput using a BLE Sniffer.

- In this Application, the GATT server configures with Custom service with write, read, and notification characteristic UUIDs.
- When connected remote device enables the notification on UUID, Silicon Labs device sends the continuous notifications to the connected device.
- This is data can be captured with Sniffer to measure the throughput.

**Sequence of Events**

This Application explains to the user how to:

- Create a Simple chat service
- Make the device advertise / scannable
- Connect from remote BLE device/ Connect to remote BLE device
- Initiate the Security
- Excite the Data length and Phy rate features
- Sends the notification messages to the connected peer/Smartphone when the notification is enabled
