## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to exchange continuous data to the remote device to measure the On-Air Throughput using a BLE Sniffer.

- In this Application, the GATT server configures with Custom service with write, read, and notification characteristic UUIDs.
- When connected remote device enables the notification on UUID, Silicon Labs device sends the continuous notifications to the connected device.
- This is data can be captured with Sniffer to measure the throughput.

**Sequence of Events**

This application explains to the user how to:

- Create a Simple chat service
- Make the device advertise / scannable
- Connect from remote BLE device/ Connect to remote BLE device
- Initiate the Security
- Excite the Data length and Phy rate features
- Sends the notification messages to the connected peer/Smartphone when the notification is enabled

Follow the steps for successful execution of the program:

1. After the program gets executed, the Silicon Labs module will be in an Advertising state by default.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. Open a nRF Connect App on the Smartphone and do the scan.

4. In the App, the Silicon Labs module device will appear with the name configured in the macro **RSI_BLE_DEVICE_NAME (Ex: "BLE_THROUGHPUT")**

    ![ble_throughput_advertiser](resources/readme/blethroughputadvertiser.png)

5. Initiate a connection from the App.

6. After successful connection, Simplicity Connect App(formerly EFR Connect App) displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.

    ![ble_throughput_device_connected](resources/readme/blethroughputdeviceconnected.png)

7. Select the attribute service which is added **RSI_BLE_NEW_SERVICE_UUID**
   **(Ex: 0xAABB)**
   
8. Enable notifications for the read attribute **RSI_BLE_ATTRIBUTE_2_UUID**
   **i.e 0x1BB1, it will start the data transfer for given attribute.**
