# BLE Secure Connection

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure SiWx91x device in peripheral role and how to connect it to a remote device. By default, our module has enable the SMP secure connection is enabled in the module.

In this application, module connects with remote device and initiates SMP pairing process.  After successful SMP pairing, SMP encryption will be enabled in both Central and Peripheral device.

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

   ![](resources/readme/load_image2.png)

### 5.3 Running the SiWx91x Application

1. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs device will be in advertising state.

2. Connect any serial console for prints.

3. Open a EFR Connect mobile App in the Smartphone and do the scan.Ensure that the device is not bonded prior . Open the bonded tab and if the application name appears then click on the three dots beside the name and select delete bond information.

4. In the App, Silicon Labs  will appear with the name configured in the macro "BLE_SMP_SC" or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "SimpleBLEPeripheral".

5. Initiate connection from the App.

6. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and Silicon Labs device.When application sends a smp request accept it on remote side by clicking ok(pair) and after smp passkey display event .

7. Enter the passkey displayed on the console (host logs) on the remote mobile side  

8. After successful connection, application will initiate SMP paring and wait for SMP response event and SMP passkey request event. After receiving SMP response and SMP SC passkey events, application sends SMP response and stores passkey in numeric value and sets SMP Sc Passkey responses event.

9. If SMP is successful, Device sends SMP encrypt started event to host. If not success, Device sends SMP failure event to host.

## 5.4 Observing the output prints on serial terminal
