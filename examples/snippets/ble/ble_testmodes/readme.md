### 6 Application Execution Flow
Application has the feasibility to configure the TX Testmodes (or) RX Testmodes.
### 6.1 TX Testmodes Execution

1. Once the program is executed, the Silicon Labs module will begin transmitting packets with the desired length.
2. Attach the dongle to a Linux machine and execute the hcitool command.
3. Use the following command with the third-party dongle to verify whether the Silicon Labs module's packets are being transmitted:
	hcitool -i hcix cmd 0x08 0x001D 0x10
(Replace hcix with the interface of the third-party dongle, and 0x10 with the received channel.)
4. The received channel of the third-party dongle should match the transmit channel of the Silicon Labs module.
5. To cease receiving, execute the following command using the third-party dongle.
	hcitool -i hcix cmd 0x08 0x001F
(Replace hcix with the interface of the third-party dongle.)
6. Verify the status parameters whether the packets are received or not after receiving stop command.
7. For reference, consult the provided images displaying prints from the third-party dongle.
8. Refer the below images for Third party dongle prints
   - commands log

### 6.2 Configuring the Application for Rx:
1. Once the program is executed, the Silicon Labs module will be ready to receive packets.
2. Utilize the following command with the third-party dongle to transmit packets to the Silicon Labs module.
3. Execute the command below using the third-party dongle to send packets to the Silicon Labs module:
	hcitool -i hcix cmd 0x08 0x001E 0x10 0x20 0x01
(Replace hcix with the interface of the third-party dongle, 0x10 with the received channel, 0x20 with the payload length, and 0x01 with the payload type.)
4. Received channel of Silicon Labs module should be same as transmit channel of Third party dongle.
5. Refer the below images for Third party dongle prints
