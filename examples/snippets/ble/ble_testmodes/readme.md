The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes if needed.

- In the Project Explorer pane of the IDE, expand the **ble_testmodes** folder and open the **app.c** file. 

   - **TX Testmodes configurations:** 

      - `RSI_CONFIG_TEST_MODE` refers the Transmit Mode of the Silicon Labs module to be selected.
        ```c
        #define RSI_CONFIG_TEST_MODE                          RSI_BLE_TESTMODE_TRANSMIT
        ```
      - `RSI_BLE_TX_PAYLOAD_LEN` refers the transmit packet length.
        ```c
        #define RSI_BLE_TX_PAYLOAD_LEN                        0x20
        ```

      - `RSI_BLE_TX_PAYLOAD_TYPE` refers the transmit packet payload type
        ```c
        #define RSI_BLE_TX_PAYLOAD_TYPE                       PRBS9_SEQ
        ```

      - `RSI_SEL_ANTENNA` refers the antenna which is to be used by Silicon Labs module, Valid configurations are RSI_SEL_INTERNAL_ANTENNA and RSI_SEL_EXTERNAL_ANTENNA
        ```c
        #define RSI_SEL_ANTENNA                               RSI_SEL_INTERNAL_ANTENNA
        ```

   - **RX Testmodes configurations:** 

      - `RSI_CONFIG_TEST_MODE` refers the Receive Mode of the Silicon Labs module to be selected.
        ```c
        #define RSI_CONFIG_TEST_MODE                          RSI_BLE_TESTMODE_RECEIVE

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application in Studio depending on your mode (SoC / NCP).
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps for the successful execution of the application:

Application has the feasibility to configure the TX Testmodes (or) RX Testmodes.

### TX Testmodes Execution

1. Once the program is executed, the Silicon Labs module will begin transmitting packets with the desired length.
2. Attach the dongle to a Linux machine and execute the hcitool command.
3. Use the following command with the third-party dongle to verify whether the Silicon Labs module's packets are being transmitted:

   - `hcitool -i hcix cmd 0x08 0x001D 0x10` 

    Replace hcix with the interface of the third-party dongle, 

    **opcode:**

     - 0x08 refers to OGF for LE controller commands,
     - 0x001D refers to OCF for LE Receiver Test command,

    **parameter:**
    
     - 0x10 with received channel which refers to parameters passed for Receiver command
     
  >  **Note:**
  >  - For HCI command format refer to section 5.4.1 | Vol 4, Part E in Core Specification 5.4
  >  - For LE receiver test command format refer to section 7.8.28 | Vol 4, Part E in Core Specification 5.4
  
4. The received channel of the third-party dongle should match the transmit channel of the Silicon Labs module.
5. To cease receiving, execute the following command using the third-party dongle.
 hcitool -i hcix cmd 0x08 0x001F
(Replace hcix with the interface of the third-party dongle.)
6. Verify the status parameters whether the packets are received or not after receiving stop command.
7. For reference, consult the provided images displaying prints from the third-party dongle.
8. Refer the following images for third party dongle prints:

   - bt mon log

### Configuring the Application for Rx

1. Once the program is executed, the Silicon Labs module will be ready to receive packets.
2. Utilize the following command with the third-party dongle to transmit packets to the Silicon Labs module.
3. Execute the following command using the third-party dongle to send packets to the Silicon Labs module:

   - `hcitool -i hcix cmd 0x08 0x001E 0x10 0x20 0x01` 
    
   Replace hcix with the interface of the third-party dongle, 
   
   **opcode:**
    - 0x08 refers to OGF for LE controller commands,
    - 0x001E refers to OCF for LE Receiver Test command,
   
   **parameter:**
    - 0x10 transmitted channel which refers to parameter passed for transmitter command
    - 0x20 payload length
    - 0x01 payload type

  > **Note:**
  > - For LE transmitter test command format refer to section 7.8.29 | Vol 4, Part E in Core Specification 5.4

4. Received channel of Silicon Labs module should be same as transmit channel of third party dongle.

5. Refer the following images for third party dongle prints.
