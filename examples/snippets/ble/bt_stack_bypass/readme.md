### 2.2 Software Requirements

- [WiSeConnect SDK](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/)
    
- Embedded Development Environment

   - For STM32, use licensed [Keil IDE](https://www.keil.com/demo/eval/arm.htm)

   - For Silicon Labs EFx32, use the latest version of [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)
   
- Download and install the Silicon Labs [EFR Connect App](https://www.silabs.com/developers/efr-connect-mobile-app) in the android smart phones for testing BLE applications. Users can also use their choice of BLE apps available in Android/iOS smart phones.

## 3. Application Build Environment

### 3.1 Host Interface

* By default, the application is configured to use the SPI bus for interfacing between Host platforms(STM32F411 Nucleo / EFR32MG21) and the SiWx91x EVK.
* This application is also configured to use the SDIO bus for interfacing between Host platforms(EFM32GG11) and the SiWx91x EVK.

### 3.2 Project Configuration

- **SoC Mode**
  - **Silicon Labs SiWx91x SoC**. Follow the [Getting Started with SiWx91x SoC](https://docs.silabs.com/) to setup the example to work with SiWx91x SoC and Simplicity Studio.
- **NCP Mode**
  - **Silicon Labs EFx32 Host**. Follow the [Getting Started with EFx32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/) to setup the example to work with EFx32 and Simplicity Studio.
  - **STM32F411 Host**. Follow the [Getting Started with STM32](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-stm32/) to setup the example to work with STM32 and Keil.

### 3.3 Bare Metal/RTOS Support

This application supports bare metal and RTOS environment. By default, the application project files (Keil and Simplicity Studio) are provided with bare metal configuration. 

## 4. Application Configuration Parameters

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1** Open `USART.c` file

**4.1.1** User must enable the below parameters if they are not enabled

#define RTE_USART0_CHNL_UDMA_TX_EN         1

#define RTE_USART0_CHNL_UDMA_RX_EN         1

Modify above parameters in components/device/silabs/si91x/mcu/drivers/cmsis_driver/USART.c

### 5.1 Loading the SiWx91x Firmware

Refer [Getting started with PC ](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started) to load the firmware into SiWx91x EVK. The firmware binary is located in `<SDK>/firmware/`

### 5.2 Building the Application on the Host Platform

Follow the procedure mentioned in the links provided under section **Project Configuration** to build and run the application. 

### 5.3 Common Steps

1.After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs module will be in uart receive state.
2.Add the hciattach file from below path examples\snippets\ble\bt_stack_bypass\binaries in Fedora
3.Change the permissions for the hciattach file added in Fedora by giving below command - chmod 777 hciattach
4.Send the below command to make Silicon labs module Up - ./hciattach -s 115200 /dev/ttyUSB0 any
5.Send the below command to check the device interface with BD_ADDR is up or not - hciconfig
6.Send the below commands to check the basic functionality - hciconfig -a hciX leadv (for advertisement) - hcitool -i hciX lescan (for scanning), X - device interface
7.Send the below command to remove the device - pkill hciattach
