# BLE Acceptlist

## 1. Purpose / Scope

This application is used to add a particular BD-Address to the White List. The device to connect is saved on the white list located in the LL block of the controller.

This enumerates the remote devices that are allowed to communicate with the local device. The White List can restrict which device are allowed to connect to other device.

If it is not, it wont connect. Once the address was saved, the connection with that device is going to be an auto connection establishment procedure.

This means that the Controller autonomously establishes a connection with the device address that matches the address stored in the While List.

## 2. Prerequisites / Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### 2.1 Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC with Host interface(UART/ SPI/ SDIO).
  - SiWx91x Wi-Fi Evaluation Kit. The SiWx91x supports multiple operating modes. See [Operating Modes]() for details.
  - **SoC Mode**:

  - **NCP Mode**:
    - Silicon Labs [BRD4180B](https://www.silabs.com/);
    - Host MCU Eval Kit. This example has been tested with:
      - Silicon Labs [WSTK + EFR32MG21](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/efr32xg21-bluetooth-starter-kit)
- BLE peripheral device

### 2.2 Software Requirements

- Embedded Development Environment

  - For Silicon Labs EFx32, use the latest version of [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)- Download and install the Silicon Labs [EFR Connect App](https://www.silabs.com/developers/efr-connect-mobile-app) in the android smart phones for testing BLE applications. Users can also use their choice of BLE apps available in Android/iOS smart phones.

## 4 Application Build Environment

### 4.1 Application Configuration

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1.1** In the Project explorer pane of the IDE, expand the **ble_accept_list** folder and open the **app.c** file. Configure the following parameters based on your requirements.    
![ble_acceptlist_application_configuration](resources/readme/bleacceptlistapplicationconfiguration.png)

**4.1.2** **Remote device configuration parameters**

  ```c
  // RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR_TYPE refers to the address type of the remote device to connect.
  //! Based on address type of remote device, valid configurations are LE_RANDOM_ADDRESS and LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
 
	#define RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR_TYPE                          LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS 
  
  //RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR refers to the address of the remote device to connect.
  
  #define RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR                               "00:1A:7D:DA:71:48" 
  
  //RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME refers to the name of remote device to which Silicon Labs device has to connect.

	#define RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME                         "SILABS_DEV"

   //RSI_BLE_ACCEPTLIST_DEV_ADDR1_TYPE and RSI_BLE_ACCEPTLIST_DEV_ADDR1_TYPE refers address of the remote devices to be acceptlisted
	#define RSI_BLE_ACCEPTLIST_DEV_ADDR1_TYPE              LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
	#define RSI_BLE_ACCEPTLIST_DEV_ADDR2_TYPE              LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS

   //Address of the device to add in white list, Update the address in little indian format
   uint8_t ble_acceptlist_addr1[6] = { 0x48, 0x71, 0xDA, 0x7D, 0x1A, 0x00 };

   //Address of the device to add in white list,Update the address in little indian format
   uint8_t ble_acceptlist_addr2[6] = { 0xB9, 0x70, 0x80, 0xA7, 0x23, 0x00 };

   // To clear whitlist, If this define is enabled specify the bd address of the device which has to remove from acceptlist
   #define DELETE_ACCEPTLIST 0
  ```
  
  **Note:** you required to configure either the `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR` or `RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME` of the remote device.

**4.1.3** Open **ble_config.h** file and configure the Opermode command parameters.   
![ble_acceptlist_configuration](resources/readme/bleacceptlistconfiguration.png)   

- **SCAN based Acceptlist Configurations**

   ```c
   //RSI_BLE_SCAN_TYPE refers to the SCAN type either SCAN_TYPE_ACTIVE or SCAN_TYPE_PASSIVE
   
   #define RSI_BLE_SCAN_TYPE        SCAN_TYPE_ACTIVE

   //RSI_BLE_SCAN_FILTER_TYPE refers to the SCAN filter type
   #define RSI_BLE_SCAN_FILTER_TYPE SCAN_FILTER_TYPE_ONLY_ACCEPT_LIST
   ```

- **Opermode command parameters**
  This configuration can be found in app.c as `config`	

   **Note:** `ble_config.h` and `app.c` files are already set with desired configuration in respective example folders you need not change for each example.
