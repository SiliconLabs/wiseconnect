## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how a GATT client device accesses a GATT server device for long read, means when user wants to read more than MTU(minimum of local and remote devices MTU's) size of data.

- Silicon Labs module acts as a GATT client/server(based on user configuration) and explains reads/writes.
- Client role is initialized with Battery Service. 
- Server role is initialized with a custom service.

**Sequence of Events**

This Application explains to the user how to:

- Advertising in PERIPHERAL role
- Connects with remote device in CENTRAL role.
- Loop back the data came from the remote device
- Read request to the remote device

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application in Studio.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps below for successful execution of the application:

> **Note:** The provided mobile screenshots are from the 2.5.2 version of the Simplicity Connect App(formerly EFR Connect App), it is recommended to use the latest version.

### BLE GATT_long_read Application as a Server

1. After the program gets executed, If Silicon Labs device is configured as `SERVER` specified in the macro `GATT_ROLE`, Silicon Labs will be in Advertising state.
2. Connect any serial console for prints.
3. Open the Simplicity Connect App(formerly EFR Connect App) in the Smartphone and do the scan.
4. In the App, Silicon Labs module device will appear with the name configured in the macro `RSI_BLE_APP_GATT_TEST (Ex: "LONG_READ_TEST")` or sometimes observed as Silicon Labs device as internal name "**SimpleBLEPeripheral**".

      ![](resources/readme/blegattlrdeviceadvertising.png)

5. Initiate connection from the App.
6. After successful connection, Simplicity Connect App(formerly EFR Connect App) displays the supported services of Silicon Labs module.

      ![](resources/readme/blegattlrdeviceconnected.png)

7. After connecting, mtu size will be updated. As per mtu size, write will be happen from Silicon Labs device.
8. If mtu size is of 100 bytes, module can read upto 98 bytes, write upto 97 bytes.
9. For the data more than 20 bytes, application has to store value and send using gatt_read_response function whenever remote device reads some handle's data.

      ![](resources/readme/blegattlrdatasent.png)

> **Note:** For read request event to be raised auth_read flag in rsi_ble_add_char_val_att function need to be set.
>- Based on GATT_ROLE configurable macro, this application will be act as a GATT server or GATT client device.   

 Prints can see as below in any Console terminal:

- **SOC**

- **NCP**

### BLE GATT_long_read Application as a Client

1. After the program gets executed, If Silicon Labs device is configured as `CLIENT` specified in the macro `GATT_ROLE`, Silicon Labs will be in Advertising state.
2. Connect any serial console for prints.
3. Open the Simplicity Connect App(formerly EFR Connect App) and Create the **Battery service** to configure the Remote device as a GATT server.
   - Name: Battery service
   - UUID: 0x180F
   > **Note:** Refer the [Adding Services](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for creating the GATT server the Simplicity Connect mobile App(formerly EFR Connect App) as advertiser.
4. Add the characteristic services and their coresponding properties as shown below:
   - Name: Battey level
   - UUID: 0x2A19
   - Property: Read & Write  
   **Note:** Refer the [Adding Characteristics and Descriptors](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for creating the GATT server in the Simplicity Connect mobile App(formerly EFR Connect App).

   ![](resources/readme/blegattleconfigurator.png)

5. Configure the advertiser.
   > **Note:** Refer the [Creating New Advertisement Sets](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for configuring the Simplicity Connect mobile App(formerly EFR Connect App) as advertiser. 

   ![](resources/readme/blegattlradvertiser.png)

6. In Client mode, the Silicon Labs module will trying to connect with remote device as specified by `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR` or `RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME`.
7. Get all GATT profiles of remote device and Search for profile specified in the macro `RSI_BLE_NEW_CLIENT_SERVICE_UUID`. And get all characteristics of the battery service.
8. After connecting, mtu size will be updated. As per mtu(maximum transmit unit) size, read requests will be happen from Silicon Labs device.
