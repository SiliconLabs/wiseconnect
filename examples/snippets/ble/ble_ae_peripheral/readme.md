    #define RSI_APP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED                     1
    ```

- Open `ble_config.h` file and update/modify following macros,

  - The desired parameters are provided following steps. User can also modify the parameters as per their needs and requirements.

  - `RSI_BLE_SET_RAND_ADDR` refers random address of the devce to be set while advertising

    ```c
    #define RSI_BLE_SET_RAND_ADDR                    "11:22:33:44:55:66"
    ```

## Test the Application

### Instructions for Simplicity Studio IDE and Silicon Labs devices (SoC and NCP Modes)
Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application
- Flash, run and debug the application
### Instructions for Keil IDE and STM32F411RE MCU

- Build the application.
- Set the Docklight up by connecting STM32's Serial COM port. This enables you to view the application prints.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:

1. Set the desired name Silicon Labs device needs to advertise in `RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME` and its random address in `RSI_BLE_SET_RAND_ADDR`. User needs to populate `RSI_BLE_ADV_INT_MIN` and `RSI_BLE_ADV_INT_MAX` with desired values for minimum advertsing interval and maximum advertsing interval.

2. After the program gets executed, from remote device scan for Silicon Labs device which advertsises with the remote device specified in `RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME` macro.

3. Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and SiWx91x. 

   > **Note:** Examples for BLE peripherals: Bluetooth Dongle, mobile application, TA sensor tag.
   
7. After successful program execution the prints in teraterm looks as shown in following image.
