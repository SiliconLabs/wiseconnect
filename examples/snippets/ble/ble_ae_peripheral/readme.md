## Test the Application

### Instructions for Simplicity Studio IDE and Silicon Labs devices (SoC and NCP Modes)
Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application
- Flash, run and debug the application
### Instructions for Keil IDE and STM32F411RE MCU

- Build the application.
- Set the Docklight up by connecting STM32's Serial COM port. This enables you to view the application prints.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:

1. Set the desired name Silicon Labs device needs to advertise in `RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME` and its random address in `RSI_BLE_SET_RAND_ADDR`. User needs to populate `RSI_BLE_ADV_INT_MIN` and `RSI_BLE_ADV_INT_MAX` with desired values for minimum advertsing interval and maximum advertsing interval.

2. After the program gets executed, from remote device scan for Silicon Labs device which advertsises with the remote device specified in `RSI_BLE_LOCAL_NAME` macro or check for device address specified in `RSI_BLE_SET_RAND_ADDR` macro
