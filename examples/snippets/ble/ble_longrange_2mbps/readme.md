# BLE Longrange 2Mbps

## 1. Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure/connects SiWx91x as a Central and can be used to update the PHY rates either coded PHY(long range) or 2Mbps PHY rates. The PHY update Procedure is used to change the Transmit or receive PHYs, or both.

The procedure can be initiated either on a request by the host or autonomously by the Link Layer. Either the central or the peripheral may initiate this procedure at any time after entering the Connection State.

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

### 4.1 Configure the application

Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

**4.1** Open `app.c` file and update/modify following macros,

**4.1.1** User must update the below parameters

- `RSI_DEVICE_DATA_RATE` refers the PHY data rate of the Silicon Labs module to be selected.

- If user configures, **LONG_RANGE**, Silicon Labs module will update PHY data rates to coded PHY data rate. By default it is configured to 500kbps PHY data rate.

- If user configures, **TWO_MBPS**, Silicon Labs module will update 2Mbps PHY data rates.

```c
    #define RSI_DEVICE_DATA_RATE                LONG_RANGE
```

- `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR_TYPE` refers address type of the remote device to connect.

```c
  #define RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR_TYPE                         LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS
```

- Based on the address of the advertising device, Valid configurations are

  - LE_RANDOM_ADDRESS
  - LE_PUBLIC_ADDRESS

   **Note:** Depends on the remote device, address type will be changed.

- `RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR` refers address of the remote device to connect.

```c
  #define RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR                          "00:23:A7:80:70:B9"
```

- `RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME` refers the name of remote device to which Silicon Labs device has to connect

```c
  #define RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME                              "SILABS"
```

   **Note:**
   Silicon Labs module can connect to remote device by referring either RSI_BLE_DEV_ADDR or RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME of the remote device.

**Power save configuration**

- By default, The Application is configured without power save.

```c  
  #define ENABLE_POWER_SAVE 0
```

- If user wants to run the application in power save, modify the below configuration.

```c  
  #define ENABLE_POWER_SAVE 1
```

**4.1.2** The desired parameters are provided below. User can also modify the parameters as per their needs and requirements

**4.1.3** Open `ble_config.h` file and update/modify following macros,

```c
  #define RSI_BLE_PWR_INX                                   30
  #define RSI_BLE_PWR_SAVE_OPTIONS                          0 
```

**Note:**
   `ble_config.h` files are already set with desired configuration in
   respective example folders user need not change for each example.

### 4.3.2 Steps to be followed to verify BLE Long Range Application

1. Configure the remote BLE device in advertising mode. For remote mobile if connecting using name ensure that the device is named same as the value mentioned in RSI_REMOTE_DEVICE_NAME macro also see to it that Complete local name record is added to advertising data and Scan response data and connectable is ticked in options.

   **Note:** Refer the [Creating New Advertisement Sets](https://docs.silabs.com/bluetooth/5.0/miscellaneous/mobile/efr-connect-mobile-app) for configuring the EFR connect mobile APP as advertiser.

2. After the program gets executed, Silicon Labs device tries to connect with the remote device specified in **RSI\_BLE\_DEV\_ADDR** **or RSI\_REMOTE\_DEVICE\_NAME** macro.

3. Clicks on "YES AND OPEN" button and Observe that the connection is established between the desired device and Silicon Labs device.

4. After connection, Silicon Labs device will read PHY rate of the remote device and set PHY rate of the remote device.

5. Observe PHY update complete event after setting PHY rate.

6. When Silicon Labs module is configured as **LONG_RANGE** PHY data rate, the Slicon Labs module and remote device updates its PHY data rate to 500kbps and prints in teraterm looks as shown below.

7. When Silicon Labs module is configured as **TWO_MBPS** PHY data rate, the Slicon Labs module and remote device updates its PHY data rate to 1mbps and prints in teraterm looks as shown below.
