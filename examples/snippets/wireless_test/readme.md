### **Below are the commands to run the RF test example.**

- **Transmit Test Commands for Wi-Fi**
![Tx Commands](resources/readme/tx_commands.png)

1. wifi_init -i **mode** for initializing the WiFi interface and for selecting the mode.

    e.g., wifi_init -i transmit_test

2. wifi_set_antenna -i client -a **antenna type** is used for selecting the antenna.

    e.g., wifi_set_antenna -i client -a 0
By default antenna type should be set to 0.

3. wifi_transmit_test_start **power** **data rate** **length** **mode** **channel**

    e.g., wifi_transmit_test_start 127 0 100 1 1.

- For Wi-Fi 6 or 802.11ax mode RF test, issue the following command. 
4. wifi_ax_transmit_test_start **power** **data rate** **length** **mode** **channel** **aggr.enable** **enable_11ax** **coding_type** **nominal_pe** **ul_dl** **he_ppdu_type** **beam_change** **bw** **stbc** **tx_bf** **gi_ltf** **dcm** **nsts_midamble** **spatial_reuse** **bss_color** **he_siga2_reserved** **ru_allocation** **n_heltf_tot** **sigb_dcm** **sigb_mcs** **user_sta_id** **user_idx** **sigb_compression_field**

    e.g., wifi_ax_transmit_test_start 127 263 1500 0 1 1 1 0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 192 1 0 0 0 0 0

  **power**: Set transmit power in dbm. Valid values are from 2 dBm to 21 dBm.

  **data rate**: Set transmit data rate

The values for the data rates can be obtained from the **sl_wifi_constants.h** file available in the SDK. 

**length**: Configure length of the transmit packet. Valid values are in the range:

[24 ... 1500] bytes in burst mode

[24 ... 260] bytes in continuous mode

**mode**: Transmit mode

**![Tx modes](resources/readme/tx_modes.png)**

**Note**:

**Burst Mode**:
DUT transmits a burst of packets with the given power, rate, and length in the channel configured. The burst size will be 
determined by the **length** parameter. If the **length** parameter is zero, then DUT keeps transmitting till 
stop API is called.

**Continuous Mode**:
The DUT transmits an unmodulated waveform continuously. 

**Continuous Wave Mode (Non-Modulation) in DC Mode**:
The DUT transmits a spectrum only at the center frequency of the channel. A basic signal with no modulation is that of a sine 
wave and is usually referred to as a continuous wave (CW) signal. A basic signal source produces sine waves. Ideally, the 
sine wave is perfect. In the frequency domain, it is viewed as a single line at some specified frequency.

**Continuous Wave Mode (Non-Modulation) in Single Tone Mode (Center Frequency -2.5 MHz)**:
The DUT transmits a spectrum that is generated at -2.5 MHz from the center frequency of the channel selected. Some amount 
of carrier leakage will be seen at Center Frequency.
For example, for 2412 MHz, the output will be seen at 2409.5 MHz.

**Continuous Wave Mode (Non-Modulation) in Single Tone Mode (Center Frequency +5 MHz)**:
The DUT transmits a spectrum that is generated at 5 MHz from the center frequency of the channel selected. Some amount of 
carrier leakage will be seen at Center Frequency.
For example, for 2412 MHz, the output will be seen at 2417 MHz. 

>**Note**
>
>1. Before starting CW mode, it is required to start Continuous mode with power and channel values, which are intended to be used 
>in CW mode as follows:
>
>    a. Start Continuous mode with intended power value and channel value; pass any valid values for rate and length.
>
>    b. Stop Continuous mode.
>
>    c. Start CW mode.
>
>2. To switch CW mode, stop PER mode and then give CW mode.
>
>3. Generally, it is recommended to measure the TX power with “Burst mode” or “Continuous mode” only. "Continuous wave 
>mode" for TX power measurement is not recommended. "Continuous wave mode" can be used for certification purposes and 
>to measure the frequency error. 
>
>    **channel**: Set the Channel number.

- The Wi-Fi 6 parameter descriptions are mentioned in the [sl_si91x_protocol_types.h](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-driver/sl-si91x-request-tx-test-info-t) file of the SDK.
>
>5. **wifi_transmit_test_stop** is used for stopping the Transmit test.

**Note**: The current CLI supports input parameters up to 30 parameters. If you want to increase the input parameters, configure these in the settings of the CLI application --> Properties> GNU ARM C compiler -> preprocessor -->  SL_SI91X_CLI_CONSOLE_MAX_ARG_COUNT=30 as shown in the image below.

**![Max_arg_count](resources/readme/max_arg.PNG)**

## Steps to create a CLI command based on the application available in the release. 

**For example, if the user wants to create a CLI command for Station ping example:**

  Refer to the flow of the station ping example available in the release/SDK. 

  a. Initilization

  b. scan for the configured access point

  c. connect to the configured access point

  d. ping to the gateway address. 

### **Below are the CLI commands for calibration.**

**Calibration write**
 
 si91x_calibration_write **flags** **gain_offset_low** **gain_offset_mid** **gain_offset_high** -c **xo_ctune** -t **target**

### Steps/commands to run the Gain offset correction
1. Initialize --->  wifi_init -i transmit_test
2. Antenna command ---> wifi_set_antenna -i client -a 0
3. Transmit test command ---> wifi_transmit_test_start 18 0 100 0 1
4. Si91x_calibration_write command ---> si91x_calibration_write 16 10 0 0 -c 0 -t 1
5. Reset the board
6. Issue the initialization command again ---> wifi_init -i transmit_test
7. Antenna command ---> wifi_set_antenna -i client -a 0
8. Transmit test command ---> wifi_transmit_test_start 18 0 100 0 1



 ## **Frequency Offset**

### **Commands to run the Frequency offset correction**

 si91x_frequency_offset **frequency_offset_in_khz**


1. wifi_init -i transmit_test
2. wifi_set_antenna -i client -a 0
3. wifi_transmit_test_start 20 0 100 0 6
4. si91x_frequency_offset 70
5. si91x_calibration_write 2 0 0 0 -t 1

**Note**: -t parameter is the target for efuse or flash, 0 represents burn into efuse, and 1 represents burn into flash. 

 **Steps/commands to run the calibration example**

 1. Initialize
 2. Antenna command
 3. Transmit test command
 4. Si91x_calibration_write command
 5. Reset the board
 6. Issue the initialisation command again
 7. Antenna command
 8. Transmit test command 

The change in the Transmit power will be observed on the display of the spectrum analyzer. 

Refer to the [calibration application note](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/application-notes/an1436-siwx917-qms-crystal-calibration-application-note.pdf) for more information.


**Here are the few examples for the si91x_calibration_write in channel 1, 6, and 11.** 

**For channel 1**

si91x_calibration_write 16 -4 0 0 -c 0 -t 1

The above command will increase the Transmit power to 2 dBm in channel 1. The second parameter (gain offset low) is configured to increase or decrease the Transmit power in the particular channel. The minus sign in the second parameter will increase the Transmit power configured in the command.

**For channel 6**

si91x_calibration_write 32 4 0 0 -c 0 -t 1

The above command will decrease the Transmit power to 2 dBm in channel 6.  

**For channel 11**

si91x_calibration_write 64 0 0 -2 -c 0 -t 1

The above command will increase the Transmit power to 1 dBm in channel 11.

## Steps to add new commands for wireless_test application

1. First add the ‘key-value’ pair in the *console_command_database* structure in **console_commands/src/console_command_database.c** file as shown below:

   - The ‘key’ is the name of new command to be created, and the value is the structure variable for the command.
     **![keyvalue](resources/readme/picture1.png)**
	
Here the new command is: *wireless_test_new_cmd*
The structure variable for the newly created command is *_wireless_test_new_cmd_command*.

2. The *_wireless_test_new_cmd_command* structure variable should be declared in the **console_commands/src/console_command_database.c** file with the following fields:

    **![cmdstructure](resources/readme/picture2.png)**

**The description of the new command:**

- The description of the new command is a string which explains briefly about the command.

**The command handler for the new command:**

- In the above figure, *wireless_test_new_cmd_command_handler* is the command handler which needs to be defined.
- For any new command, we have to declare a function in **console_commands/src/console_command_database.c** file with a specific proptotype as shown below.
*extern sl_status_t wireless_test_new_cmd_command_handler( console_args_t* arguments );*

- The function name can be anything, but the return type and argument must be as aforesaid mentioned.

**The string array for argument description of the command handler:**

- In the above figure, *_wireless_test_new_cmd_arg_help* is the string array which needs to be defined.
- We need to define a string array in **console_commands/src/console_command_database.c** file which briefly explains about the arguments in the command handler. Following is the declaration.

  **![cmdhandler](resources/readme/picture4.png)**

We have given the description for all three strings as 0.

**The list of data types of arguments of command handler:-**

- Referring to the *_wireless_test_new_cmd_command* structure variable image, { CONSOLE_OPTIONAL_ARG('s', CONSOLE_ARG_STRING ), CONSOLE_ARG_UINT, CONSOLE_ARG_INT, CONSOLE_ARG_END } }  are the list of datatypes corresponding to the list of arguments.
- The data types CONSOLE_ARG_UINT corresponds to ‘uint’ , CONSOLE_ARG_INT corresponds to ‘int’, and CONSOLE_ARG_STRING corresponds to ‘string’. The list of arguments must end with CONSOLE_ARG_END.
- The arguments can be mandatory or optional. The mandatory arguments are given directly, but optional arguments are given using an expression, CONSOLE_OPTIONAL_ARG (‘character’, datatype). The ‘character’ is an alphabet which is the user's choice and can be used to give an optional argument in a cli command. The datatype can be anything mentioned above.
- In addition to standard data type arguments like uint, int, and string, there can be enums which can also be passed as arguments to a command. The arguments we need to pass in a command depend on what APIs we call in a command handler.  
- For some of the Wi-Fi APIs, we call inside a command handler. We may need to use the argument values as specified in the *console_argument_values* variable defined in **console_commands/src/console_argument_types.c** file. For passing those values in a CLI command, we need to look for the corresponding argument types defined in the same file.
For example, we may want to pass a data rate as *SL_WIFI_RATE_11B_1* enum value in a CLI command. The corresponding uint32 array is mapped to *[CONSOLE_TYPE(data_rate)]*. We need to search for *data_rate_type* string array in the same file as shown below. 
The string corresponding to *SL_WIFI_RATE_11B_1* is "1Mbps". So *1Mbps* should be passed as an argument in the CLI command.
In the command handler, the arguments passed in the cli command are internally mapped to corresponding enum values and can be accessed directly using GET_COMMAND_ARG() or GET_OPTIONAL_COMMAND_ARG().
