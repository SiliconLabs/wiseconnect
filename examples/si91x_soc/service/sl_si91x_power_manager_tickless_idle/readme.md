## Purpose/Scope

 This application demonstrates the power manager service APIs, active state transitions (PS4, PS3, and PS2), standby state transitions (PS4, PS3, and PS2) and sleep-wakeup (PS4, PS3, PS2, and PS1 sleep with RAM retention) with tick-less idle mode.

## Overview

- Tick-less Mode, a capability offered by the FreeRTOS real-time operating system (RTOS), enables the system to diminish power usage by transitioning into a low-power state during periods of task inactivity.
- The power_manager_tickless_idle example application updates the power state based on the user's selection when the OS timer expires. It then identifies the highest attainable operating state and initiates the transition. When the application becomes idle, the power manager triggers either sleep or standby mode, depending on the value of the SL_SI91X_STANDBY macro.
- Sleep or Standby - Demonstrations of wake-up with RAM retention are showcased in PS4, PS3, and PS2 states, automatically adjusting to the attainable state.
 
 **Note:** In this application, the Ultra-Low Power (ULP) Timer is configured as the wakeup source from the PS1. The Power Manager supports the following ULP peripherals as a wakeup sources during the PS1 state:
  | **ULP Peripherals Supported** |
  |---------------------| 
  | *ULP GPIO*       | 
  | *ULP Timer*      |
  | *ULP ADC*        | 
  | *ULP Comparator* | 
  | *ULP UART*       | 
> To configure the other peripheral in PS1 State, refer to the [SiWx917 Software Reference Manual](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v3.3.1/docs/software-reference/manuals/siwx91x-software-reference-manual.md).

## About Example Code

- Power Manager service is initialized in PS3 state with 40MHz clock (Power Save) using sl_si91x_power_manager_init.
- At initialization, a thread is created and the application_start() function is called along the thread.
- All the activities are handled in the application_start() function.
- Firstly wifi is initialized, M4-NWP secure handshake is established to send commands to NWP, NWP is switched to STANDBY_WITH_RAM_RETENTION mode.
- All the possible events are `OR`'ed and passed to the `sl_si91x_power_manager_subscribe_ps_transition_event` along with the callback function address.
- On OS timer expiry, it updates the requirement and changes the highest attainable operating state and performs sleep-wakeup operations.
- By default, the System RTC (SysRTC) and wireless interface are configured as wake-up sources for PS4, PS3 and PS2 sleep. The application enters sleep based on the idle time determined by the scheduler and resumes operation upon receiving either a wireless wake-up event or a SysRTC interrupt. In the PS1 state, wake-up occurs exclusively through the ULP Timer.

## Application Build Environment

You can configure the application to suit your requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

To enable transitions from the active state to sleep or standby state, configure the parameters outlined below accordingly.

  - By default, the SL_SI91X_STANDBY macro is configured with a value of 0, indicating that the application performs the following sequence of power state transitions:
  - PS3 State => PS3 Sleep => PS3 State =>PS2 State => PS2 Sleep => PS2 State => PS1 State => PS2 State => PS4 State => PS4 Sleep => PS4 State => PS3 State and repeat.

    ```c
    #define SL_SI91X_STANDBY                                      0 
    ```

  - To enable the Standby state transition, set the SL_SI91X_STANDBY macro to 1. With this configuration, the application performs the following sequence of power state transitions:
  - PS3 State => PS3 Standby => PS3 State => PS2 State => PS2 Standby => PS2 State => PS4 State => PS4 Standby => PS4 State => PS3 State and repeat.

    ```c
    #define SL_SI91X_STANDBY                                      1
    ```

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Test the Application

Refer instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#build-an-application) for the following tasks:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. By default it initializes the wifi and switches NWP to standby with RAM retention mode, power manager service is initialized and callback is subscribed.
3. After successful program execution, observe the prints in the serial console.
