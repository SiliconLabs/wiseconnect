## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrates the use of Third Generation Non-Volatile Memory (NVM3) data storage in Si91x common flash.
- This application performs Wifi init to allow communication between TA and M4.
- This application writes initializes NVM3 and does following operations:

  1. Store 4 keys in flash using NVM3 write
  2. Display 4 keys stored
  3. Delete 4 keys

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

- To use this application following Hardware, Software and the Project Setup is required.

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs [Si917 Evaluation Kit WPK(BRD4002) + BRD4325B]
  - The Serial Console setup instructions are provided below,
refer instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-soc-mode#perform-console-output-and-input-for-brd4338-a).

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Embedded Development Environment
  - For Silicon Labs Si91x, use the latest version of Simplicity Studio (refer **"Download and Install Simplicity Studio"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html**)

## Getting Started

Refer instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) for the following tasks:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Test the Application

- Users observes following prints on console.

## API Locking and Interrupt handling

- The default NVM3 protection functions (nvm3_lockBegin() and nvm3_lockEnd()) can be substituted by the application if other syncronization functions are available and disabling interrupts for extended periods is not desired.
- This application provides freeRTOS based lock-begin and lock-end implementation.
