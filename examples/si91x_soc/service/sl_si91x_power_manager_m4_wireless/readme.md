## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrates the power manager service APIs, state transitions, sleep-wakeup (with RAM retention) and sleep-wakeup (without RAM retention).

## Overview

- According to the macros configured in power_manager_example.h file, it executes the state transition and sleep-wakeup with RAM retention on button press, sleep-wakeup without RAM retention using second trigger as wakeup source.
- State transitions demonstrated are as follows: PS4 -> PS2, PS2 -> PS4, PS4 -> PS4 Sleep -> PS4, PS4 -> PS3, PS3 -> PS3 Sleep -> PS3, PS3 -> PS2, PS2 -> PS2 Sleep -> PS2, PS2 -> PS1 -> PS2, PS2 -> PS3, PS3 -> PS4. It switches the state at the time of button press.
- Sleep - wakeup without RAM retention is demonstrated as follows: PS4 -> PS0 -> wakeup -> restart the controller.
- For the integration of power manager in other projects, refer the instructions at the given path: **examples/si91x_soc/service/power_manager_m4_wireless/resources/power_manager_integration_guide/power_manager_integration.pdf** 

## About Example Code

- At initialization, a thread is created and the application_start() function is called along the thread.
- All the activities are handled in the application_start() function.
- Firstly wifi is initialized, M4-TA secure handshake is established to send commands to TA, TA is switched to STANDBY_WITH_RAM_RETENTION mode.
- Power Manager service is initialized, the processor is switched to PS4 state and the clock is 100 MHz (Power Save) using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_init.
- All the possible events are ored and passed to the \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_subscribe_ps_transition_event along with the callback function address.
- RAM retention is enabled and configured using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_configure_ram_retention.

- Upon button press, it changes the state and performs sleep-wakeup operations.
  - PS4 -> PS2: Unwanted peripherals are powered off using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_peripheral_requirement, PS2 state requirement is added using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement.
  - PS2 -> PS4: To transmit to PS2, remove the requirement for the PS2 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_ps_requirement and add a requirement for the PS4 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement switches the power state to PS4.
  - PS4 -> PS4 Sleep -> PS4:
    - Wakeup Source is selected as the calendar second trigger. The calendar peripheral is initialized before setting it as a wakeup source, the RC clock is selected using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_set_configuration, the calendar is initialized using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_init, the second trigger is selected as wakeup source using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_set_wakeup_sources, Now callback is registered for second trigger (it enables the trigger also) using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_register_sec_trigger_callback.
    - Now soc goes to sleep using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_sleep. Upon wake-up, the calendar is stopped using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_rtc_stop and callback is unregistered using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_unregister_sec_trigger_callback.

  - PS4 -> PS3: To transmit to PS3, remove the requirement for PS4 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_ps_requirement and add the requirement for PS3 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement switches the power state to PS3.
  - PS3 -> PS3 Sleep -> PS3:
    - Wakeup Source is selected as the calendar second trigger. The calendar peripheral is initialized before setting it as a wakeup source, the RC clock is selected using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_set_configuration, the calendar is initialized using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_init, the second trigger is selected as wakeup source using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_set_wakeup_sources, Now callback is registered for second trigger (it enables the trigger also) using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_register_sec_trigger_callback.
    - Now soc goes to sleep using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_sleep. Upon wake-up, the calendar is stopped using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_rtc_stop and callback is unregistered using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_unregister_sec_trigger_callback.

  - PS3 -> PS2: Unwanted peripherals are powered off using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_peripheral_requirement. To transmit to PS2, remove the requirement for PS3 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_ps_requirement and add the requirement for PS3 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement switches the power state to PS3.
  - PS3 -> PS2: Unwanted peripherals are powered off using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_peripheral_requirement. To transmit to PS2, remove the requirement for PS3 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_ps_requirement and add the requirement for PS3 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement switches the power state to PS3.
  - PS2 -> PS2 Sleep -> PS2:
    - Wakeup Source is selected as the calendar second trigger. The calendar peripheral is initialized before setting it as a wakeup source, the RC clock is selected using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_set_configuration, the calendar is initialized using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_init, the second trigger is selected as wakeup source using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_set_wakeup_sources, Now callback is registered for second trigger (it enables the trigger also) using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_register_sec_trigger_callback.
    - Now soc goes to sleep using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_sleep.
    - Upon wakeup, the calendar is stopped using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_rtc_stop and the callback is unregistered using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_unregister_sec_trigger_callback.
  - PS2 -> PS1 -> PS2:
    - Wakeup Source is selected as ULP Timer. ULP Timer peripheral is initialized before setting it as a wakeup source. It is initialized using \ref sl_si91x_ulp_timer_init, set the match value for 2 seconds and configured the ULP Timer using \ref sl_si91x_ulp_timer_set_configuration. Now callback is registered for the second trigger (it enables the trigger also) using \ref sl_si91x_ulp_timer_register_timeout_callback. ULPSS-based wakeup source is selected using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_set_wakeup_sources.
    - Now the timer is started using \ref sl_si91x_ulp_timer_start. The requirement is added for PS1 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement.
    - Upon wakeup timer is stopped using \ref sl_si91x_ulp_timer_stop and callback is unregistered using \ref sl_si91x_ulp_timer_unregister_timeout_callback and the wakeup source is cleared using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_set_wakeup_sources.

  - PS2 -> PS3: To transmit to PS3, remove the requirement for the PS2 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_ps_requirement and add the requirement for the PS3 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement switches the power state to PS3.
  - PS3 -> PS4: To transmit to PS3, remove the requirement for PS3 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_remove_ps_requirement and add the requirement for PS4 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement switches the power state to PS4.

  - PS4 -> PS0 -> Restarts the soc
    - The TA is switched to STANDBY_POWER_SAVE which means, sleep without retention.
    - Wakeup Source is selected as the calendar second trigger. The calendar peripheral is initialized before setting it as a wakeup source, the RC clock is selected using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_set_configuration, the calendar is initialized using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_init, the second trigger is selected as wakeup source using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_set_wakeup_sources, Now callback is registered for second trigger (it enables the trigger also) using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_register_sec_trigger_callback.
    - It goes to PS0 state using \ref sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement. After waking up using the calendar one-second trigger, it restarts the controller.
