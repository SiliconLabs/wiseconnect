## Purpose/Scope

When flashed with this example the boot count get updated in the "boot_count" file on every boot-up.

**boot_count File:** This file is to store the boot count value and this will be available in the flash memory.

## Overview

- This example interfaces with flash through QSPI interface using littlefs.
- The program can be interrupted at any time without losing track of how many times it has been booted and without corrupting the filesystem.

## About Example Code

- The example code in [`file_system_example.c`](file_system_example.c) shows how to set up QSPI to access flash memory for a file system using the LittleFS library.
- Initialize QSPI for LittleFS using `sl_si91x_littlefs_qspi_init()`.
- To use the file system, call `lfs_mount()`.
- Open a file and read the current boot count  `lfs_file_read()`.
- Update the boot count `lfs_file_write()`.
- Close the file using `lfs_file_close()` and unmount the file system using `lfs_unmount()`.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs SiWx91x Evaluation Kit [[BRD4002](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wireless-pro-kit-mainboard?tab=overview) + [BRD4338A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-rb4338a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board?tab=overview) / [BRD4342A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx91x-rb4342a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board?tab=overview) / [BRD4343A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siw917y-rb4343a-wi-fi-6-bluetooth-le-8mb-flash-radio-board-for-module?tab=overview) / [BRD4343C](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siw917y-rb4343c-wi-fi-6-bluetooth-le-8mb-flash-radio-board-for-module?tab=overview)]

>**Note:**
>- LittleFS service is not supported on stacked flash boards. However, if the board supports external flash, users can connect external flash to access the LittleFS service.
>- For detailed information about pinset configurations, refer to the **Flash and PSRAM Combinations** section in the [Software Reference Manual](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.1.1-content-for-docs/docs/software-reference/manuals/siwx91x-software-reference-manual.md).

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Serial console Setup
  - For Serial Console setup instructions, refer to [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#console-input-and-output).

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#install-the-wiseconnect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#connect-siwx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#update-siwx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#create-a-project)

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

1. Run the application.
2. Observe boot_count on console output.

> **Note**:
>
>- When you run the littlefs example the first time, after flash erase you see the error `(error: Corrupted dir pair at {0x0, 0x1})` because flash is not yet formatted for littlefs. Ignore the error when running the example the first time.

## Troubleshooting

- If the project does not build, ensure Simplicity Studio and the WiSeConnect extension are installed and the board is connected.
- If the device is not detected, reinstall the connectivity firmware and check USB drivers.
