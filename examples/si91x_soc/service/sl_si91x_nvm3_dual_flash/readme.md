## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrates the use of Third Generation Non-Volatile Memory (NVM3) data storage in Si91x dual flash.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

- To use this application following Hardware, Software and the Project Setup is required

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs [Si917 Evaluation Kit WPK(BRD4002) + BRD4325B]
  - The Serial Console setup instructions are provided below,
refer instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-soc-mode#perform-console-output-and-input-for-brd4338-a).

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Embedded Development Environment
  - For Silicon Labs Si91x, use the latest version of Simplicity Studio (refer **"Download and Install Simplicity Studio"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html**)

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

Refer instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) for the following tasks:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

### Code modifications for printing on the uart console

- In rsi_board.c file make M4_UART1_INSTANCE as 1 and M4_UART2_INSTANCE as 0

### Pinout on WPK for uart console

| GPIO pin                | Description             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| GPIO_30 [EXP_HEADER-4] | UART Tx   |
| GPIO_29 [EXP_HEADER-6] | UART Rx  |
| [EXP_HEADER-1]  | GND    |

## Test the Application

- Users can give the following commands:

  - For storing new key, type below syntax followed by enter
    write key string
    ex: write 1 SiliconLabs
  - For reading data from key, type below syntax followed by enter
    read key
    ex: read 1
  - For deleting key, type below syntax followed by enter
    delete key
    ex: delete 1

- After successful program execution the prints in serial console looks as shown below.
