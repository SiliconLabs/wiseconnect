# WLAN Throughput from PSRAM

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application executes from PSRAM and demonstrates the procedure to measure WLAN UDP/TCP/TLS throughput by configuring the SiWx91x in client/server role.
In this application, the SiWx91x connects to a Wi-Fi access point, obtains an IP address, connects to Iperf server/client or python based TLS scripts, running on a remote PC and measures Tx/Rx throughput transmitted/received from remote PC.

    #define UDP_TX           2   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote UDP client
    #define UDP_RX           3   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote UDP server
    #define TLS_TX           4   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TLS server

    ```

### 4.2 Build the Application

  **![Build as](resources/readme/build_project_soc.png)**

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

#### 4.3.1 Testing Throughput steps at remote system

There are two 'ends' involved when measuring throughput, data is sent between the client end and the server end. By default, the Iperf protocol sends data from the Client to the Server to measure throughput. Depending on the configuration selected, the SiWx91x may be the client or the server. In general, it is advisable to start the server before the client since the client will immediately begin to try to connect to the server to send data.

The following sections describe how to run the SiWx91x throughput application together with examples for various Iperf configurations that run on the PC.

## Running the SiWx91x Application

After making any custom configuration changes required, build, download and run the application as described in the [EFx32 Getting Started](https://docs.silabs.com/rs9116-wiseconnect/latest/wifibt-wc-getting-started-with-efx32/).

## UDP Tx Throughput

To measure UDP Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP client and start a UDP server on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the UDP server on the PC is:

> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -u -p 5001 -i 1`

## UDP Rx Throughput

To measure UDP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a UDP server and start a UDP client on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the UDP client is:

> `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -u -p <Module_Port> -i 1 -b <Bandwidth> -t <time interval in seconds>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.100 -u -p 5001 -i 1 -b 50M -t 30`  

![Figure: UDP_RX](resources/readme/image217a.png)

## TCP Tx Throughput

To measure TCP Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a TCP client and start a TCP server on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the TCP server is:
  
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -s -p 5001 -i 1`

![Figure: TCP_TX](resources/readme/image217d.png)

## TCP Rx Throughput

To measure TCP Rx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as TCP server and start a TCP client on the remote PC.
The Iperf command to start the TCP client is:

> `C:\> iperf.exe -c <Module_IP> -p <module_PORT> -i 1 -t <time interval in sec>`
>
> For example ...
>
> `C:\> iperf.exe -c 192.168.0.100 -p 5001 -i 1 -t 30`  

![Figure: TCP_RX](resources/readme/image217c.png)

## TLS Tx Throughput

To measure TLS Tx throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a TLS client and start a TLS server on the remote PC as described in the following bullets:

- Copy the `SSL_Server_throughput_d.py` script from the release `/resources/scripts/` directory to the `/resources/certificates/` directory
- Open a command prompt and cd to the folder `/resources/certificates/`, then run the following command:
  - `C:\> python SSL_Server_throughput_d.py`

**Note:** **The SSL_Server_throughput_d.py script works only with Python version 2 and above.**  

![Figure: TLS_TX](resources/readme/image217f.png)

## TLS Rx Throughput

To measure TLS RX throughput, configure the SiWx91x as a TLS client and open a TLS server on the remote PC as described in the following bullets:

- Copy the `SSL_tx_throughput.py` script from the release `/resources/scripts/` directory to the `/resources/certificates/`
- Open a command prompt and cd to the folder `/resources/certificates/`, then run the following command:
  - `C:\> python SSL_tx_throughput.py`

**Note:** **The SSL_tx_throughput.py script works only with Python version 2 and above.**  

![Figure: TLS_RX](resources/readme/image217e.png)

The SiWx91x, which is configured as a UDP/TCP/TLS server/client, connects to the iperf server/client and sends/receives data for configured intervals. While module is transmitting/receiving the data, application prints the throughput numbers in serial console.
