## Purpose/Scope

The app starts in provisioning mode over BLE. User can use the Simplicity Connect iOS/Android app to scan for available Wi-Fi networks, select their desired network, enter the network credential, and then transmit the credential over a secure BLE connection.

Once provisioned, the app then connects to the selected network and brings up the sensor webserver. Users can then use their the Simplicity Connect iOS/Android app to view the sensor data collected by the dev kit board.

All device activities can be observed on the serial terminal prints. You may use a readily available terminal program such as [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html) or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).

- After upgrading the application binary, proceed with the demo by referring to the next steps under [run the application](#run-the-application) section.

## Application Build Environment

- Configure the following Wi-Fi parameters in `wifi_app.c`:

- `WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID`: Specifies the SSID of the Wi-Fi network to which the device connects as a station. Update the string with the name of your Wi-Fi network.

  ```c
  #define WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID "YOUR_INITIAL_AP_SSID" // Wi-Fi network SSID
  ```

- `WIFI_SCAN_TIMEOUT`: Specifies the maximum time (in milliseconds) the Wi-Fi scan operation waits for a response before timing out. By default, it is set to 10000.

  ```c
  #define WIFI_SCAN_TIMEOUT         10000                   // Wi-Fi scan timeout in ms
  ```

- `DHCP_HOST_NAME`: Specifies the host name advertised by the DHCP client. By default, it is set to `NULL`, meaning no host name is sent.

  ```c
  #define DHCP_HOST_NAME            NULL                    // DHCP host name
  ```

- `APP_RECONN_LOOP_CTR_LIM`: Specifies the maximum number of reconnection attempts before the application gives up on re-establishing the Wi-Fi connection. By default, it is set to 3.

  ```c
  #define APP_RECONN_LOOP_CTR_LIM   3                       // Reconnection loop counter limit
  ```

- Configure the following server parameters in `sensor_app.c`:

- `HTTP_SERVER_PORT`: Specifies the HTTP server port used by the application to serve sensor data over HTTP. By default, it is set to 80.

  ```c
  #define HTTP_SERVER_PORT        80     // HTTP server port
  ```

- `SERVER_PORT`: Specifies the TCP server port used by the sensor application for data exchange. By default, it is set to 5000.

  ```c
  #define SERVER_PORT             5000   // Server port
  ```

- `SCAN_RESULT_BUFFER_SIZE`: Specifies the size (in bytes) of the buffer used to hold Wi-Fi scan results. By default, it is set to 2000.

  ```c
  #define SCAN_RESULT_BUFFER_SIZE (2000) // Scan result buffer size
  ```

- Configure the following BLE parameter in `ble_app.c`:

- `RSI_BLE_APP_DEVICE_NAME`: Specifies the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device name advertised by the application. By default, it is set to `"WIFI_SENSOR"`.

  ```c
  #define RSI_BLE_APP_DEVICE_NAME "WIFI_SENSOR" // BLE device name
  ```

- Configure the following parameter in `app.c`:

- `RSI_TCP_IP_BYPASS`: Enables or disables the TCP/IP bypass mode. When enabled, the host handles the TCP/IP stack; when disabled, the NWP handles it. By default, it is set to `RSI_DISABLE`.

  ```c
  #define RSI_TCP_IP_BYPASS RSI_DISABLE // TCP/IP bypass mode
  ```

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Run the Application

**Step 1** : The SiWx91x device starts in provisioning mode. All device activities can be observed on the serial terminal prints.

![Startup Prints](resources/readme/startup-prints.png)

**Step 2** : Launch the Simplicity Connect app and select the `Wi-Fi Sensors` demo.

![Wi-Fi Sensors Demo](resources/readme/wifi-sensors-demo.png)

**Step 3** : The Simplicity Connect app starts scanning for the `WIFI_SENSOR` device on BLE. Select the `WIFI_SENSOR` device on the Simplicity Connect app.

![Startup Prints](resources/readme/wifi-sensor-device-selection.png)

**Step 4** : Select your desired network, enter password, and then click `Ok`. The Simplicity Connect app then transmits the network credential securely over BLE connection.

![Selecting a Network](resources/readme/selecting-a-network.png)

![Entering password](resources/readme/entering-password.png)

**Step 5** : The SiWx91x dev kit switches to Wi-Fi Station mode and connects to the selected Wi-Fi network. The Simplicity Connect app then connects to the sensor webserver running on the dev kit board. Wait until connection is established.

## Troubleshooting

- If the project does not build, ensure that Simplicity Studio and the WiSeConnect extension are installed and the board is connected.
- If the device is not detected, reinstall the connectivity firmware and check USB drivers.
