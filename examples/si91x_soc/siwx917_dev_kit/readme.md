## Purpose/Scope

The app starts in provisioning mode over BLE. User can use the Simplicity Connect iOS/Android app to scan for available Wi-Fi networks, select their desired network, enter the network credential, and then transmit the credential over a secure BLE connection.

Once provisioned, the app then connects to the selected network and brings up the sensor webserver. Users can then use their the Simplicity Connect iOS/Android app to view the sensor data collected by the dev kit board.

All device activities can be observed on the serial terminal prints. You may use a readily available terminal program such as [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html) or [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

 Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Wireless Access Point
- **SoC Mode**:
  - Kits
    - BRD2605A (SiWG917 Dev Kit Board)
- Android Phone or iPhone with Simplicity Connect App (formerly EFR Connect App), which is available in Play Store and App Store (or) Windows PC with windows Silicon labs connect application.

### Software Requirements

- [Simplicity Studio](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-studio)
- Silicon Labs [Simplicity Connect App (formerly EFR Connect App)](https://www.silabs.com/developers/simplicity-connect-mobile-app?tab=downloads), the app can be downloaded from Google Play store/Apple App store.
  > IMPORTANT: This example requires Simplicity Connect version 2.9.3 or later.

## Application Build Environment

> **Note**: For recommended settings, see the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Run the Application

**Step 1** : The SiWG917 device starts in provisioning mode. All device activities can be observed on the serial terminal prints.

![Startup Prints](resources/readme/startup-prints.png)

**Step 2** : Launch the Simplicity Connect app and select the `Wi-Fi Sensors` demo.

![Wi-Fi Sensors Demo](resources/readme/wifi-sensors-demo.png)

**Step 3** : The Simplicity Connect app starts scanning for the `WIFI_SENSOR` device on BLE. Select the `WIFI_SENSOR` device on the Simplicity Connect app.

![Startup Prints](resources/readme/wifi-sensor-device-selection.png)

**Step 4** : Select your desired network, enter password, and then click `Ok`. The Simplicity Connect app then transmits the network credential securely over BLE connection.

![Selecting a Network](resources/readme/selecting-a-network.png)

![Entering password](resources/readme/entering-password.png)

**Step 5** : The SiWG917 dev kit switches to Wi-Fi Station mode and connects to the selected Wi-Fi network. The Simplicity Connect app then connects to the sensor webserver running on the dev kit board. Wait until connection is established.
