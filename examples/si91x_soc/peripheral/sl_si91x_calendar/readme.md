## Purpose/Scope

- This example demonstrates the clock configuration, one millisecond trigger, one second trigger, alarm configuration and time conversion.

  > **Note:** Before enabling any trigger, it is recommended to calibrate the clock.

## Overview

- Calendar calculates milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days, months and years up to 4 centuries.
- It also calculates days of week and takes care of number of days in month as well as leap year.
- It can also configure alarm for desired time as a one-shot trigger.
- It can generate triggers on one second and one millisecond time interval.
- It uses APB for read and write operations in real time.
- RC clock and RO clock are configurable, and it can also be calibrated using the APIs.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates clock configuration, set calendar date-time, calendar get date-time, set alarm date-time, get alarm date-time, alarm trigger, one millisecond trigger, one second trigger and clock calibration.
- To configure the calendar clock, select the clock from UC. \ref sl_si91x_calendar_config is used to set the calendar clock.
- A structure is created which contains default values for calendar date-time. It is created using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_build_datetime_struct, After entering all the parameters, it returns a structure filled with all the parameters.
- Calendar date-time is configured using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_set_date_time API. It configures the date time and the calendar blocks starts counting from that time.
- To verify if the desired time is set, \ref sl_si91x_calendar_get_date_time API is used, It returns a structure which has current date-time.

- If **ALARM_EXAMPLE** macro is enabled:

  - A date-time structure is created using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_build_datetime_struct for configuring the Alarm.
  - Alarm is configured using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_set_alarm API.
  - Now callback is registered to perform action at the time of trigger using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_register_alarm_trigger_callback API.
  - To verify if the desired alarm is set, \ref sl_si91x_calendar_get_alarm API is used, It returns a structure which has configured alarm date-time.
  - At the time of trigger, it prints current date-time on the console.

- If **CLOCK_CALIBRATION** macro is enabled:
  
  - This clock calibration applies to RO and RC Clock only. For RO clock \ref sl_si91x_calendar_roclk_calibration should be used and for RC clock \ref sl_si91x_calendar_rcclk_calibration should be used.
  - It is recommended to calibrate clock before activating any trigger after every power cycle.
  - Initialization of clock is performed using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_calibration_init API.
  - To select the clock in UC, follow the procedure mentioned in "Configuration and Steps for Execution" section.
  - According to the clock configured in UC, either RO or RC, use respective API to configure the clock. In this example RC clock is selected so \ref sl_si91x_calendar_rcclk_calibration API is used.
  - This API expects \ref clock_calibration_config_t structure. For rc_trigger_time, \ref RC_CLOCK_CALIBRATION_ENUM enum can be used, and for ro_trigger_time \ref RO_CLOCK_CALIBRATION_ENUM enum can be used.
  - After calibration \ref sl_si91x_calendar_rtc_start is called to start the calendar clock.

- If **SEC_INTR** macro is enabled:

  - Callback is registered for one second trigger using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_register_sec_trigger_callback API.
  - At every one second, the console prints `one_sec_callback`.

- If **MILLI_SEC_INTR** macro is enabled:

  - Callback is registered for one millisecond trigger using \ref sl_si91x_calendar_register_msec_trigger_callback API.
  - At every one second, the console prints `on_msec_callback triggered 1000 times`.
  - It accumulates the 1000 trigger at one millisecond time frame and prints at only one second.

- If **TIME_CONVERSION** macro is enabled:

  - This converts NTP time to Unix Time and vice versa.
  - In this example, \ref sl_si91x_calendar_convert_unix_time_to_ntp_time API is called to convert unix time to ntp time, it expects unix time as parameter.
  - It updates the variable with ntp time which is passed as parameter.
  - After conversion, ntp time and unix time are printed on the console.
  - Now \ref sl_si91x_calendar_convert_ntp_time_to_unix_time API is used to convert ntp time to unix time, it expects ntp time as parameter.
  - It updates the variable with unix time which is passed as parameter.
  - After conversion, ntp time and unix time are printed on the console.

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

### Application Configuration Parameters

- Configure UC from the slcp component.
- Open **sl_si91x_calendar.slcp** project file select **software component** tab and search for **Calendar** in search bar.
- Using configuration wizard one can configure the Calendar clock, i.e., RO, RC and XTAL.

  ![Figure: Introduction](resources/uc_screen/calendar_uc_screen.png)

- Configuration file is generated in **config folder**, if not changed then the code will run on default UC values.
- Configure the following macros in calendar_example.h file and update/modify following macros if required.

- `ALARM_EXAMPLE`: If ALARM_EXAMPLE is enabled, it prints "Alarm Callback is Triggered" on console when alarm is triggered. By default, it is set to 0.

  ```C
    #define ALARM_EXAMPLE     0 // To enable alarm trigger 
  ```

- `CLOCK_CALIBRATION`: If CLOCK_CALIBRATION is enabled, after calibration "Successfully performed clock calibration" print is there on serial console. By default, it is set to 0.

  ```C
    #define CLOCK_CALIBRATION 0 // To enable clock calibration 
  ```

- `SEC_INTR`: If SEC_INTR is enabled, every one second "One Sec Callback is Triggered" print is there on serial console. By default, it is set to 0.

  ```C
    #define SEC_INTR          0 // To enable one second trigger 
  ```

- `MILLI_SEC_INTR`: If MILLI_SEC_INTR is enabled, every one second "One Milli-Sec Callback triggered 1000 times" print is there on serial console. By default, it is set to 0.

  ```C
    #define MILLI_SEC_INTR    0 // To enable one millisecond trigger 
  ```

- `TIME_CONVERSION`: If TIME_CONVERSION is enabled, time conversion between unix and ntp is printed on serial console. By default, it is set to 0.

  ```C
    #define TIME_CONVERSION   0 // To enable time conversion 
  ```
