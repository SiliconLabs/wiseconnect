## Purpose/Scope

- This Config Timer ICU OCU example demonstrates 2 use cases of a timer:
  - First as a input capture event. Here it captures the input event on GPIO pin and store the captured value in
  capture_value variable.
  - Second as a CT DMA used to generate varied PWM waveform. counter-0 and counter-1 will generate PWM output with varied duty cycle.
  

## Overview

- Configurable timers are used for counting clocks and events, capturing events on the GPIOs in input mode, and outputting modulated signals. They can be programmed to work in Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) mode in which a pulse width modulated wave is driven on the outputs according to the programmed ON time and OFF times. Configurable Timers are present in MCU HP peripherals.
  - There is a programming feature to select Clocks, events or external clock as a tick.
  - The input clock can be the reference clock or the system clock.
  - Supports a wide range of features like starting the counter, stopping the counter, continuing the counter from the stopped value, halt and increment the counter, and capturing the events.
  - It can output PWM signals with any cycle/pulse length.
  - It can start a PPG in synchronous with PWM signal output. It can superimpose a PPGs output signal on the PWM signal and output it.
  - It can generate a non-overlap signal that maintains the response time of the power transistor(dead time) from PWM signal output.
  - It can capture timing of input signal changes and pulse width in synchronous with PWM signal.
  - It can start the ADC at any time, in synchronous with the PWM signal output.
  - It performs noise cancelling of the emergency motor shutdown interrupt signal.
  - It can freely set the pin state at the time of motor shutdown when a valid signal input is detected.
  - Supports APB interface for programming.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates the Config Timer as a Input Capture and Output Compare. Output Compare Values are updated using DMA.
- Configure the following macros in `config_timer_icu_ocu_example.h`[(https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ct_icu_ocu_with_dma/config_timer_icu_ocu_example.h)]to change the application use case.Two macros are present: CT_COUNTER_INPUT_EVENT_USECASE and CT_COUNTER_DMA_MODE_USECASE. By default, the input capture use case is enabled.
- Enable only one of the following use case macros at a time.
  - If **CT_COUNTER_INPUT_EVENT_USECASE** is enabled:
    - The Config Timer is initialized using [sl_si91x_config_timer_init()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-init) API.

    - The captured value is printed or processed as needed.
  - If **CT_COUNTER_DMA_MODE_USECASE** is enabled:
    - CT_COUNTER_DMA_MODE_USECASE is used to generate varied PWM waveform.
    - Both counter0 and counter1 compare value arrays are initialized with step increments.
    - The Config Timer is initialized using [sl_si91x_config_timer_init()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-init) API.

    - Match count for both counters is set using [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_match_count()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-match-count) API.
    - OCU (Output Compare Unit) configuration is set for both counters, enabling DMA and output toggling using [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_ocu_configuration()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-ocu-configuration) API.
    - DMA is configured for counter0 and counter1 using [sl_si91x_config_timer_dma_configure()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-dma-configure) API.
    - Callback is registered for DMA transfer completion using [sl_si91x_config_timer_register_callback()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-register-callback) API.
    - Both counters are started using [sl_si91x_config_timer_start_on_software_trigger()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-start-on-software-trigger) API.
    - On DMA interrupt, the DMA transfer index for each counter is incremented.
    - When the end of the compare value array is reached, the index wraps around to repeat the sequence.
    - The next DMA transfer is triggered for each counter.
    - CT Output-0 and Output-1 will produce a continuous varied PWM using DMA.

## Application Build Environment

- Configure the following macros in 'config_timer_icu_ocu_example.h'[(https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ct_icu_ocu_with_dma/config_timer_icu_ocu_example.h)]file to change the application use case (enable exactly only one at a time).

  ```C
    #define CT_COUNTER_DMA_MODE_USECASE   1      -  To run DMA counter mode
    #define CT_COUNTER_INPUT_EVENT_USECASE 1     -  To run input event mode
  ```
  - Also enable the relevant CT (Config Timer) configuration settings required for the PWM DMA mode use case to ensure proper operation of the timer in DMA-driven PWM output mode.
- In the `config_timer_icu_ocu_example.c`[(https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ct_icu_ocu_with_dma/config_timer_icu_ocu_example.c)] file, configure the "TIME_PERIOD_VALUE" macro to facilitate user-defined adjustments of the time period value. Modify or update the following macro as necessary to allow flexible customization of the timer's period and compare value.

  ```C
   #define TIME_PERIOD_VALUE     1000         // Time period in microseconds
   #define STEP_SIZE_COUNTER_0   400          // Step size for counter0 increments
  ```
  -  Use the **Config Timer** software component in the `.slcp` project file to configure the timer from the Simplicity Studio Component Editor (UC). Search for "Config Timer" or "CT" in the software components list to add or configure this peripheral as needed for ICU or OCU DMA mode operation.

## Test the Application

### Run the application in INPUT EVENT mode

- The Config Timer will capture external events (such as rising edge) on the configured input pin.
- Each captured event's capture value will be read and printed to the console.
- connect the IN0 pin to button0 pin (F12 which is input pin for button),press and release the button, you can see the capture value updating upon the event occured.
- Following prints will be observed on the console:

### Run the application in DMA mode

- Both CT Output-0 and CT Output-1 will generate waveforms using DMA, with compare values automatically updated from pre-defined arrays.
- The outputs will continuously repeat their waveform patterns as the DMA cycles through the arrays.
- CT Output-0 and Output-1 will produce a continuous varied PWM using DMA.
- Connect a logic analyzer to the Evaluation Kit board's GPIO-29 & GPIO-30 for output-0 and output-1 respectively to observe the DMA-driven waveforms.
- Following prints will be observed on the console:

> **Note:**
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
