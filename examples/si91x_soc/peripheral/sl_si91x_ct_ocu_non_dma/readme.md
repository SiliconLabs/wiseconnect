## Purpose/Scope

- This Config Timer example demonstrates 2 use cases of a timer:
  - First as free-running timer. Counter-0 is configured to generate interrupt. Once interrupt is trigerred we get the console message and timer is deinitialized.
  - Second as a waveform generator producing two PWM outputs: counter-1 generates a square wave (50%-duty cycle) and counter-0 will produce a waveform whose duty cycle continuously varies from 100% to 0% then 0% to 100%.
  

## Overview

- Configurable timers are used for counting clocks and events, capturing events on the GPIOs in input mode, and outputting modulated signals. They can be programmed to work in Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) mode in which a pulse width modulated wave is driven on the outputs according to the programmed ON time and OFF times. Configurable Timers are present in MCU HP peripherals.
  - There is a programming feature to select Clocks, events or external clock as a tick.
  - The input clock can be the reference clock or the system clock.
  - Supports a wide range of features like starting the counter, stopping the counter, continuing the counter from the stopped value, halt and increment the counter, and capturing the events.
  - It can output PWM signals with any cycle/pulse length.
  - It can start a PPG in synchronous with PWM signal output. It can superimpose a PPGs output signal on the PWM signal and output it.
  - It can generate a non-overlap signal that maintains the response time of the power transistor(dead time) from PWM signal output.
  - It can capture timing of input signal changes and pulse width in synchronous with PWM signal.
  - It can start the ADC at any time, in synchronous with the PWM signal output.
  - It performs noise cancelling of the emergency motor shutdown interrupt signal.
  - It can freely set the pin state at the time of motor shutdown when a valid signal input is detected.
  - Supports APB interface for programming.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates the Config Timer as a normal counter and Output Compare unit for PWM output generator.
- Configure the following macros in'config_timer_ocu_non_dma_example.h'[(https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ct_ocu_non_dma/config_timer_ocu_non_dma_example.h)]Two macros are present: CT_PWM_MODE_USECASE and CT_COUNTER_MODE_USECASE. By default, the normal counter use case is enabled.
- Enable only one of the following use case macros at a time.
  - If **CT_PWM_MODE_USECASE** is enabled:
    - The Config Timer is initialized using [sl_si91x_config_timer_init()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-init) API.
    - After initialization, the desired counter parameters are configured using [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_configuration()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-configuration) API, the parameters are set through UC.
    - Match count for both the counters are configured using same [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_match_count()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-match-count) API.
    - The desired OCU parameters are configured using [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_ocu_configuration()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-ocu-configuration) API.
    - The desired OCU controls for both counters are configured using API [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_ocu_control()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-ocu-control) by changing the counter number.
    - Registers the callback for enabling peak interrupt, for counter-1 using [sl_si91x_config_timer_register_callback()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-register-callback) API.
    - Starts both the counters using API [sl_si91x_config_timer_start_on_software_trigger()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-start-on-software-trigger) by changing the counter number.
    - After enabling OCU mode, a continuous loop for pwm output is performed.
    - It creates 2 independent PWM Outputs - CT output-0 and CT output-1.
    - CT Output-1 will produce a square wave, and CT Output-0 will produce a waveform whose duty cycle continuously varies from 100% to 0% then 0% to 100%.
    - Connect the logic analyzer to the Evaluation Kit board's GPIO-29 & GPIO-30 for output-0 and output-1 respectively and observe the PWM waveforms.
  - If **CT_COUNTER_MODE_USECASE** is enabled:
    - The Config Timer is initialized using [sl_si91x_config_timer_init()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-init) API.
    - After initialization, the desired counter parameters are configured using [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_configuration()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-configuration) API. The parameters are set using UC.
    - Set the initial count value of counter using [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_initial_count()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-initial-count) API.
    - Match count is configured using [sl_si91x_config_timer_set_match_count()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-set-match-count) API.
    - Registers the callback for enabling peak interrupt for counter-0 using [sl_si91x_config_timer_register_callback()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-register-callback) API.
    - Starts counter-0 using [sl_si91x_config_timer_start_on_software_trigger()](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/config-timer#sl-si91x-config-timer-start-on-software-trigger) API.

  ```

- Also enable the CT configuration macro for the PWM mode use case by setting `CT_PWM_MODE_USECASE` to `1` and ensuring `CT_COUNTER_MODE_USECASE` is set to `0` in the `config_timer_ocu_non_dma_example.h`[(https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ct_ocu_non_dma/config_timer_ocu_non_dma_example.h)] file.

- In the `config_timer_ocu_non_dma_example.c`[(https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ct_ocu_non_dma/config_timer_ocu_non_dma_example.c)] file, configure the "TIME_PERIOD_VALUE" macro to facilitate user-defined adjustments of the time period value for a counter-mode use case. Modify or update the following macro as necessary to allow flexible customization of the timer's period and compare value.

  ```C
   #define TIME_PERIOD_VALUE     1000         // Time period in microseconds
   
  ```

## Test the Application

### Run the application in counter mode

- To verify the counter mode, ensure that `CT_COUNTER_MODE_USECASE` is enabled in`config_timer_ocu_non_dma_example.h`[(https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ct_ocu_non_dma/config_timer_ocu_non_dma_example.h)] Build and flash the application. When the timer reaches the configured match value, an interrupt is triggered automatically. You will see a console message indicating that the interrupt has occurred, confirming that the counter mode is working as expected.
- Following prints will be observed on the console:

### Run the application in Output Compare Unit PWM mode

- CT Output-1 will produce a square wave (50% duty cycle).
- CT Output-0 will produce a waveform whose duty cycle continuously varies from 100% to 0% then 0% to 100%.
- Connect logic analyzer to the Evaluation Kit board's GPIO-29 & GPIO-30 for output-0 and output-1 respectively and observe the PWM waveforms.
- Following prints will be observed on the console:

> **Note:**
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
