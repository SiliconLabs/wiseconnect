## Purpose/Scope

- This example project demonstrates use of the Memory Liquid Crystal Display (MEMLCD) module in a bare metal application, using Silicon Labs Graphics Library (glib).

## Overview

- MEMLCD could be used to render characters, strings, QR codes and pictures.
- MEMLCD uses Silicon Labs Graphics Library (GLIB) for renders. Documentation for the library can be found at [GLIB documentation](https://docs.silabs.com/gecko-platform/3.0/middleware/api/group-glib).
- The Memory LCD-TFT available on the WPK has a resolution of 128 x 128 pixels. It is a reflective monochrome display, so each pixel can only be light or
dark, and no backlight is needed in normal daylight conditions.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates how simple strings could be rendered on the MEMLCD LS013B7DH03, present on WPK[BRD4002A].

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002) + BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
