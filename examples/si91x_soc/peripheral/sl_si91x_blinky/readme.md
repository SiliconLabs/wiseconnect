For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- Configure the following parameter in blinky.c file, update/modify following macro if required.

  ```C
    #define TOGGLE_DELAY_MS 500//  configured for 500 ms   
  ```   

## Test the Application

1. Compile and run the application.
2. Sets the board state of LED0 to ON and OFF for configured blink rate.
3. LED0 should blink on WSTK/WPK base board.

  > **Note:**
  >
  > LED0 will continuously be turned on and off.
