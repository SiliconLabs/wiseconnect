## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrate the SIO (Serial Input Output) for data transfer in SPI and UART.

## Overview

- It is a MCU HP peripheral, which is used to support a wide variety of SIO functionality.
- It can be used to implement Serial interfaces like UART, SPI protocols.
- Eight GPIOs support the SIO functionality.
- Support pattern matching based interrupt generation - the GPIO is monitored to compare against a pre-programmed bit pattern. The bit pattern can be between 1 and 32 bits.
- Generates interrupts on shift, swap (position counter reaching zero), pattern match (supported by 0,1st,2nd, 8th, 9th and 10th slices only), GPIO edge/level detection and underrun/overrun.
- Supports generation of interrupt for different events.
- Generates a shift clock from 14-bit shift counter.
- Clock used for shift operations can be internal counter clock or external clock coming in.
- Supports flow control mode in which operations and clock would be paused if data not available.
- Supports loading and reading of shift data in reverse order. This feature is required for peripherals which transmit/receive MSB first.

## About Example Code

### SIO SPI functionality

- This example demonstrates SIO SPI transfer of data between MOSI and MISO using API \ref sl_si91x_sio_spi_transfer.
- Various parameters SPI bit order, SPI clock, SPI clock channel, MOSI channel, MISO channel, SPI CS channel, bit length, SPI mode can be configured using UC. \ref pstcSpiConfig.
- sl_si91x_sio_config.h file contains the control configurations.
- In example code, firstly the output buffer is filled with some data which is to be transferred to the MISO.
- Firmware version of API is fetched using \ref sl_si91x_gspi_get_version which includes release version, major version and minor version \ref sl_sio_version_t.
- \ref sl_si91x_sio_init is used to initialize SIO.
- \ref sl_si91x_sio_spi_init is used to initialize the SIO SPI functionality, that includes SIO SPI configuration.
- After configuration, a callback register API is called to register the callback at the time of events \ref sl_si91x_sio_spi_register_event_callback.
- The current_mode is set to SL_SEND_DATA and calls the \ref sl_si91x_sio_spi_transfer API which expects structure of type \ref pstcSpiXfer, for sending and receiving data simultaneously.
- Before transfer has begin, chip select assert is to be done using \ref sl_si91x_sio_spi_cs_assert.
- This test is performed in loopback condition, i.e. connect MISO and MOSI pins.
- It waits till the transfer is completed.
- After transfer completion, chip select de-assert is to be done using \ref sl_si91x_sio_spi_cs_deassert.
- When the transfer complete event is generated, it compares the sent and received data.
- The result is printed on the console.

### SIO UART functionality

- This example demonstrates SIO UART send and receive data using API \ref sl_si91x_sio_uart_send, \ref sl_si91x_sio_uart_read.
- Various parameters UART baud rate, bit length, parity, receive channel selection, transmit channel selection, stop bits can be configured using UC. \ref UartInitstc.
- sl_si91x_sio_config.h file contains the control configurations.
- In example code, firstly the tx_buffer is filled with some data which is to be transferred to the uart receive.
- \ref sl_si91x_sio_init is used to initialize SIO.
- After configuration, a callback register API is called to register the callback at the time of events \ref sl_si91x_sio_uart_register_event_callback.
- \ref sl_si91x_sio_uart_init is used to initialize the SIO UART functionality, that includes SIO UART configuration.
- The current_mode is set to SL_SEND_DATA and calls the \ref sl_si91x_sio_uart_send API which expects tx_buffer (transmit buffer that needs to be sent) and number of bytes to send.
- Now the current_mode is set to the SL_RECEIVE_DATA and calls the \ref sl_si91x_sio_uart_read API which expects rx_buffer (empty buffer) and number of data bytes to be received.
- When the receive complete event is generated, it compares the sent and received data.
- The result is printed on the console.
