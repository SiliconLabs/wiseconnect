## Purpose/Scope

- The opamp example demonstrates the initialization, configuration, and operation of the OPAMP peripheral by giving input on non-inverting terminal and inverting terminal of the opamp and checking output. It configure OPAMP instances for various use cases, including integration with DAC for external voltage comparison. 
- In this application we can configure the 3 instances- OPAMP1, OPAMP2 and OPAMP3.
- Every opamp will have Vinp mux to select "inp", Vinn mux to select "inn," and Resistor mux for feedback.

The following configurations are used in this example:
  
- Unity Gain / Unity Gain with DAC
- Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier
- Non-Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier
- Inverting Programmable hysteresis comparator
- Non-Inverting Programmable hysteresis comparator


## Overview

- The OPAMP peripheral is a versatile analog component that can be configured for various applications such as signal amplification, buffering, and voltage comparison. 
- This example provides a step-by-step guide to initialize and configure the OPAMP peripheral based on the selected instance.
- The OPAMP has two input terminals: one for the inverting input and another for the non-inverting input, along with a single output.
