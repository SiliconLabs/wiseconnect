## Purpose/Scope

- The OPAMP example demonstrates the initialization, configuration, and operation of the OPAMP peripheral by giving input on non-inverting terminal and inverting terminal of the OPAMP and checking output. It configure OPAMP instances for various use cases, including integration with DAC for external voltage comparison. 
- In this application we can configure the 3 instances- OPAMP1, OPAMP2 and OPAMP3.
- Each OPAMP features a VinP positive input mux for selecting "inp-input positive terminal," a VinN negative input mux for selecting "inn-input negative terminal," and a resistor mux for feedback configuration.

The following configurations are used in this example:

- Unity Gain Buffer
- Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier
- Non-Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier
- Inverting Programmable hysteresis comparator
- Non-Inverting Programmable hysteresis comparator
- Cascaded Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier
- Cascaded Non-Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier
- Two OPAMPs Differential Amplifier
- Trans-Impedance Amplifier
- Instrumentation Amplifier

## Overview

- The OPAMP peripheral is a versatile analog component that can be configured for various applications such as signal amplification, buffering, and voltage comparison. 
- This example provides a step-by-step guide to initialize and configure the OPAMP peripheral based on the selected instance.
- The OPAMP has two input terminals: one for the inverting input and another for the non-inverting input, along with a single output.

- OPAMP1: Choose any GPIO from the VinP mux selection for V2 input, from the "Out selection" for output and set VinN mux to "Out" and select any GPIO from Resistor mux in the UC. Select resistors from "R1 Resistor" and "R2 Resistor" in the UC.
- OPAMP2: Choose any GPIO from the VinP mux selection for V1 input, from the "Out selection" for output and set VinN mux to "Out". Ensure the resistor mux is set to "OPAMP1_OUT" in the UC. Select resistors from "R1 Resistor" and "R2 Resistor" in the UC.
- OPAMP3: Choose "OPAMP2_Resistor_tap" from the VinP mux selection for input, from the "Out selection" for output, set VinN mux to "Resistor tap" and select "OPAMP2_OUT" from Resistor mux. Select resistors from "R1 Resistor" and "R2 Resistor" in the UC.

- Check the output voltage on board on OPAMP_OUT.
- Use a Logic analyzer / Oscilloscope  to check output voltage.
- Calculate the Output Voltage    
  [Vout2=(V2-V1)*R2/R1+Vref]

  **Notes:** 
  - The **Instrumentation Amplifier** configuration internally initializes and uses the **DAC peripheral** to provide reference voltage for the differential amplifier stage.
  - This DAC configuration is handled by the driver and does not require user intervention.
  - If you have enabled `DAC` in the OPAMP UC, this will  conflict with the internal DAC usage in Instrumentation Amplifier mode.
  - In the above formula, Vref (the DAC output voltage) depends on the OPAMP reference voltage.
    - For an OPAMP reference voltage of 3.3 V, Vref is approximately 1.65 V.
    - For an OPAMP reference voltage of 2.5 V, Vref is approximately 1.26 V.

    Use the appropriate Vref value in formula based on your selected OPAMP reference voltage.

#### Trans-Impedance Amplifier

- Apply input current signal to the inverting input terminal and connect reference voltage to the non-inverting terminal via resistor mux.
     ![Figure: Trans-Impedance Amplifier](resources/readme/trans_impedance_amp.png)
- Choose the appropriate GPIO from VinP mux selection for current input, select output from "Out selection", set VinN mux to "Resistor tap" and select any GPIO from Resistor mux. Configure feedback resistor from "R2 Resistor" selection in the UC. R1 is None.

- Check the output voltage on board at OPAMP_OUT.
- Use a Logic analyzer / Oscilloscope to monitor output voltage.
- Calculate the output voltage 
  [Vout2=Vref-Iin*R2]
  **NOTE:**
   - When DAC is enabled for input selection, VOUT is functional only on GPIO30. Avoid using ULP_GPIO_4 for VOUT, as DAC output on the same pin may cause signal interference and unreliable readings
   - When using ULP_GPIO_6 and ULP_GPIO_7, ensure that:
     - No external pull-ups are connected.
     - No internal pull-ups are enabled.

### Important Note on OPAMP Selection and Debugging

When using the **Two OPAMP Differential Amplifier** configuration, ensure that **only two OPAMPs** are selected. Selecting **three OPAMPs** will result in an error, and the intended functionality will not work.

### Affected Configurations

 This limitation applies to:

- **Cascaded Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier**
- **Cascaded Non-Inverting Programmable Gain Amplifier**
- **Two OPAMPs Differential Amplifier**

### Debugging Limitation

- **OPAMP2** utilizes **ULP_UART** pins for its configuration.
- As a result, `debug_uart` is **disabled**, which prevents error messages from being printed via the standard debug interface.
- To view debug/error prints, consider using **alternative USART/UART pins**.
