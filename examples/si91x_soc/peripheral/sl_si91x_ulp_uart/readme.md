## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure ULP UART In asynchronous mode, it will send and receive data.

## Overview

- ULP UART is used in communication through wired medium in Asynchronous fashion. It enables the device to communicate using serial protocols.
- This application is configured with following configs:
  - Tx and Rx enabled
  - Asynchronous mode
  - 8 Bit data transfer
  - Stop bits 1
  - No Parity
  - No Auto Flow control
  - Baud Rates - 115200
- HW flow control is currently not supported for ULP_UART.

## About Example Code

- [`ulp_uart_example.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/master/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ulp_uart/ulp_uart_example.c) - This example code demonstrates how to configure the UART to send and receive data in loopback mode.
- In this example, the UART is first initialized—if not already done—using [`sl_si91x_usart_init`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-init), along with clock, power mode and DMA configurations when DMA is enabled.
- After UART initialization, ULP UART is configured with default configurations from UC along with UART transmit and receive lines using the [`sl_si91x_usart_set_configuration()`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-set-configuration).
- Then the register the user event callback for send and receive complete notification is set using [`sl_si91x_usart_register_event_callback()`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-register-event-callback).
- After setting the user event callback, the data send and receive can happen through [`sl_si91x_usart_send_data`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-send-data) and [`sl_si91x_usart_receive_data`](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/usart#sl-si91x-usart-receive-data) respectively.
- Once the receive data event is triggered, both transmit and receive buffer data is compared to confirm if the received data is the same.

> **Note:** When utilizing the ULP UART instance in high-power mode with DMA enabled, it is advisable to allocate buffers in the ULP memory block.

## Application Build Environment

- Enable the ULP_UART mode in UC before running/flashing the code.

   ![Figure: ulpuart_uc](resources/readme/ulpuart_uc.png)

- Data send and receive from VCOM console is for one iteration only. On VCOM console, set the configuration such that the received data is sent back on the same port.
- To check continuous data transfer, modify the following macro to ENABLE in the [`ulp_uart_example.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/master/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ulp_uart/ulp_uart_example.h) file.

  ```c
  #define USE_SEND    ENABLE
  ```

- Set the ULP_UART_RX pin to any other GPIO than ULP_GPIO_9 because ULP_GPIO_9 is dedicated for VCOM.
- Do loopback of selected GPIO to ULP_GPIO_11 to observe toggles, once data sent and received matches.  
- The output in the logic analyser will show toggling in PS4 state 12 times as well as in PS2 and PS4 also it will toggles for 12 times respectively on the ULP_GPIO_8.

## Pin Configuration

|     SiWG917M       |      SiWG917Y     | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| ULP_GPIO_11  [F6]  | ULP_GPIO_11 [F6]  | TX (VCOM)   |
| ULP_GPIO_9   [F7]  | ULP_GPIO_9  [F7]  | RX (VCOM)   |
| ULP_GPIO_8   [P15] | ULP_GPIO_8  [P15] | GPIO_Toggle |


## Flow Control Configuration

- Set the SL_ULP_UART_FLOW_CONTROL_TYPE parameter to RTS and CTS in UC to enable UART flow control.
- Select pins for CTS and RTS.

  |      SiWG917M       |     SiWG917Y     |   Description    |           
  | ------------------  | ---------------- | ---------------  |
  |  ULP_GPIO_1  [P16]  | ULP_GPIO_1 [P16] | ULP_UART_CTS_PIN |
  |  ULP_GPIO_10 [P17]  | ULP_GPIO_0 [F10] | ULP_UART_RTS_PIN |

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the SL ULP UART example in Studio.
- Flash, run and debug the application

Follow the steps below for successful execution of the application:

1. When the application runs, ULP_UART sends and receives data in full-duplex modes
2. When TX and RX data match, ULP_GPIO_8 should be toggled for the Si917. Connect the logic analyzer to observe the toggle state.
3. Here the same pins which are used to send and receive the data are used for data transfer. As a result, you cannot observe prints. Instead, you can use GPIO toggling method as shown below.

   - when use send disabled:

   - when use send enabled:

>**Note:**
>
>- The required files for low-power state are moved to RAM. The rest of the application is executed from flash.
>- In this application, we are changing the power state from PS4 to PS2 and vice - versa.
>- Once the power state changes from PS4 to PS2 and vice - versa, you have to reconfigure the uart configs once again using sl_si91x_usart_set_configuration() API  because of frequency change. Refer to  file for more info.
- Once the power state changes from PS4 to PS2 and vice - versa, you have to reconfigure the uart configs once again using sl_si91x_usart_set_configuration() API  because of frequency change.

>- CTS and RTS only works when not using ROM driver for UART
>
> **Note:**
>
>- Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
>
>- To configure the SoC GPIO as ULP GPIO follow below code snippets, In below code snippet shown demonstrates configuring SOC_GPIO_8 and SOC_GPIO_9 as ulp_gpio_2 and ulp_gpio_3 to use as ulp_uart rx and tx pins respectively  
>- This gpio should configure as ulp_gpio's only when ulp_uart functioning in  PS4 and PS3 state.

**GPIO 8 as ULP_UART_RX:**

> **Note:**
> Header connection pin references mentioned here are all specific to BRD4338A. If user runs this application on a different board, it is recommended to refer the board specific schematic for GPIO-Header connection pin mapping.
>
> **Note:**
>
>- This application is intended for demonstration purposes only to showcase the ULP peripheral functionality. It should not be used as a reference for real-time use case project development, because the wireless shutdown scenario is not supported in the current SDK.
>- On the Si917x device, only 4KB of ULP RAM is available for application use. In this example, both the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) data buffers must be placed in ULP memory. Specifically, 2KB of ULP RAM is allocated for TX and 2KB for RX, enabling up to 2KB of data to be transmitted and received per operation.
