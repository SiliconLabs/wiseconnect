## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrate the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to generate a periodic pulse waveform, which is useful in motor control and power control applications.

## Overview

- Supports up to eight PWM outputs with four duty cycle generators. The output pins are grouped in pairs, to facilitate driving the low side and high side of a power half bridge. For more details on PWM outputs please refer block diagram in HRM.
- Complementary and Independent output modes are supported
- Dead time insertion in Complementary mode
- Manual override option for PWM output pins. Output pin polarity is programmable
- Supports generation of interrupt for different events
- Supports two hardware fault input pins

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates the generation of periodic pulse waveform with 50% duty cycle and frequency of 25Khz.
- Four macros are present i.e., DEAD_TIME, OVERRIDE, FAULT.
- If **DEAD_TIME** is enabled:
  - DEAD_TIME: To perform correct status change of the power switches in the inverter leg, a PWM generator should insert small amount of time between required switching edges for top and bottom switch. This time is called dead-time.
  - Dead time mode is applied only in complementary mode.
    - Complementary mode: In complementary PWM mode, PWM waveform output incorporates dead time (anti-short periods) to prevent overlap between the positive and anti phases.
    - Independent Mode: In Independent PWM Output mode, the PWM outputs (PWMxH and PWMxL) are phase shifted relative to each other.
  - Initialize the PWM using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_init.
  - Set configuration using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_configuration() API.
  - Set duty cycle using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_duty_cycle() API.
  - Set base timer mode using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_base_timer_mode() API.
  - Set base time period control using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_control_period() API.
  - Register callbacks using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_register_callback() API.
  - Start PWM using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_start() API.
- If **OVERRIDE** is enabled:
  - OVERRIDE: While overriding PWM outputs, the channel counters continue to run, only the PWM outputs are forced to user defined values.
  - Initialize the PWM using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_init() API.
  - Set configuration using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_configuration() API.
  - Set base timer mode using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_base_timer_mode() API.
  - Set duty cycle using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_duty_cycle() API.
  - Set base time period control using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_control_period() API.
  - Register callbacks using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_register_callback() API.
  - Start PWM using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_start() API.
- If **FAULT** is enabled:
  - FAULT: There are two fault pins, FAULTxA and FAULTxB, associated with the MCPWM(Motor Control Pulse Width Modulation) module. When asserted, these pins can optionally drive each of the PWM I/O pins to a defined state.
  - Initialize the PWM using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_init() API, \ref sl_Si91x_pwm_fault_init() API.
  - Set configuration using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_configuration() API.
  - Set base timer mode using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_base_timer_mode() API.
  - Set duty cycle using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_duty_cycle() API.
  - Set base time period control using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_control_period() API.
  - Register callbacks using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_register_callback() API.
  - Change the event generated to fault A/B flags.
  - Start PWM using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_start() API.
- If user wants to work without UC configuration, one can use their own macros and structure configuration and pass it directly in application.
- If **SVT** is enabled:
  - Initialize the PWM using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_init() API. Initialize Special Event Trigger based GPIO pin.
  - Set configuration using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_set_configuration() API.
  - Enable special event trigger using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_control_special_event_trigger() API.
  - Set configuration for special event trigger using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_trigger_special_event() API.
  - Start PWM using \ref sl_si91x_pwm_start() API.
  
>**Note:**
>
>1. PWM has four channels. User can handle these channels using instances. Each channel has 2 PWM outputs (i.e PWM_L(PWM output low), PWM_H(PWM output high)).The usage of L,H depends on application how to use them. For example, when driving something in PUSH-PULL configuration, PWM_H can drive the high-side switch, whereas PWM_L drives the low side switch. This is only a reference of how L,H can be used. There might be other scenarios, which are dependent on settings done and how to achieve it. 
>2. channel_0, channel_1, channel_2 and channel_3 are the names pre-defined for the PWM channels.
>3. For user defined instances, one may have to define his hardware specific definitions in sl_si91x_pwm_init_channel_0_config.h file (path: /$project/config/sl_si91x_pwm_init_channel_0_config.h).
>4. User can directly use APIs in application by passing appropriate structure members, if user doesn't want to configure from UC.

## Application Build Environment

### Application Configuration Parameters

- Configure the following macros in pwm_example.c file and update/modify following macros if required.

  ```C
    #define EVENT_COUNT       10    // Count of events that can generate
    #define PRESCALE_A        0x100 // PWM Prescale_A value
    #define DEADTIME_A        0x08  // PWM deadtime_A
    #define FAULT_A_ENABLE    0x11  // Fault A enable for channel 0
    #define DT_COUNTER_A      0x00  // Dead time counter A enable
    #define DT_ENABLE         0x01  // Dead time enable for channel 0
    #define INTR_EVENT        0x01  // Rise PWM time period match channel 0 event
    #define DUTY_CYCLE_UPDATE 0x01  // Enable duty cycle updating bit in register
  ```

- Configure UC from the slcp component.
- Open **sl_si91x_pwm.slcp** project file select **software component** tab and search for **PWM** in search bar.
- By default, PWM has channel 0 instance. If base timer selection is selected as Timer (All Channels), to select any other PWM channel one should have PWM channel-0 as reference. If separate PWM channels are to be considered change the base timer selection to Timer (Each Channel). 
- Using configuration wizard, one can configure different parameters:

  - **Common Configuration for all PWM Channels**
    - Base Timer Selection: There are two base timers. Timer for each channel and Timer for all channels. If Timer (All Channels) is selected, make sure PWM channel-0 is installed.

  - **General Configuration for individual PWM Channel**
    - Frequency: Frequency changes from 500Hz to 200Khz. By default 25Khz is considered.
    - Output Polarity Low: There are 2 polarities- polarity low, polarity high. The difference can be observed in waveforms, when polarity is changed. By default it is set to polarity high.
    - Output Polarity High: There are 2 polarities- polarity low, polarity high. The difference can be observed in waveforms, when polarity is changed. By default it is set to polarity high.
    - PWM Mode: There are 2 modes, independent mode and complementary mode. The definitions for these modes are covered in about example code. The difference can be seen in waveform, when modes are changed.
    - Timer Counter: This is initial base time counter value to set. By default it is set to 0.
    - Duty Cycle: By default 50% duty cycle is take. One can vary duty cycle from 0% to 100%.
    - Base Timer Mode: There are 6 different modes. By default free run mode is selected.
    - Ext Trigger: In order to enable fault A, fault B and other external triggers present, ext trigger parameter is used.

    - **Pin Configuration for individual PWM Channel**
      - The pin configuration for PWM channel can be configured under SL_PWM_CHANNEL0 section.
