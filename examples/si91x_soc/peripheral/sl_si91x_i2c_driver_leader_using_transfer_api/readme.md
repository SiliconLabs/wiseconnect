## Purpose/Scope

- The application demonstrates the data transfer from leader to follower and then follower to leader. After transmission the data is compared and result is printed on the console.

> **Note:** The master-slave terminology is now replaced with leader-follower. Master is now recognized as Leader and slave is now recognized as Follower.

## Overview

- The I2C will be configured in leader mode. The SCL and SDA lines of leader controller are connected to Follower's SCL and SDA pins.
- There are three configurable I2C controllers in M4 - two in the MCU HP peripherals (I2C1, I2C2) and one in the MCU ULP subsystem (ULP_I2C). For I2C follower all instances will in MCU HP mode.
- The I2C interface allows the processor to serve as a leader or follower on the I2C bus.
- I2C can be configured with following features
  - I2C standard compliant bus interface with open-drain pins
  - Configurable as Leader or Follower
  - Four speed modes: Standard Mode (100 kbps), Fast Mode (400 kbps), Fast Mode Plus (1Mbps) and High-Speed Mode (3.4 Mbps)
  - 7 or 10-bit addressing and combined format transfers
  - Support for Clock synchronization and Bus Clear

## About Example Code

- This example code demonstrates I2C data transfer between leader and follower using transfer API.
- In example code, first i2c instance is initialized using [sl_i2c_driver_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-driver-init) to configure various init structure parameters
- This structure includes:
  - [sl_i2c_operating_mode_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-operating-mode-t) bus speed, it can be Standard, Fast, Fast plus or High speed.
  - [sl_i2c_mode_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-mode-t) mode, it should be leader mode for leader application.
  - [sl_i2c_transfer_type_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-transfer-type-t), using NON-DMA.
  - [sl_i2c_callback_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-callback-t) , I2C callback
- It also initializes I2C clock and configures I2C SDA & SCL pins.
- Now transmit and receive FIFO threshold values are configured using [sl_i2c_driver_configure_fifo_threshold](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-driver-configure-fifo-threshold) API.
- Now repeated start is enabled for data transfer using [sl_i2c_driver_enable_repeated_start](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-driver-enable-repeated-start) API. So that master continue read operation after write operation without releasing line.
- Now write_buffer is filled with some data which needs to be sent to the follower.
- Current_mode enum is set to I2C_TRANSFER_DATA and it calls transfer_data API to send data to follower & configures follower address through [sl_i2c_driver_transfer_data](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-driver-transfer-data) (first sends & then receives data in blocking mode).
- Now it compares the data which is received from the follower device to the data which it has sent.
- If the send & receive data is same, it will print Test Case Passed on the console.
- When all bytes are received then mode changes to I2C_TRANSMISSION_COMPLETED (API won't update any transfer complete flag, as control will be blocked until all bytes are received).
- I2C driver gets in I2C_TRANSMISSION_COMPLETED mode and stays idle.

> **Note:**
>
>- I2C has three instances. User can handle these i2c-instances by adding their instances.
>- I2C0, I2C1 & I2C2 are the names pre-defined for the I2C instances
>- For user defined instances, one may have to define his hardware specific definitions in config.h file.
>- User can directly use APIs in application by passing appropriate structure members, if user doesn't want to configure from UC.
>- It is recommended to install only a single instance that is specifically intended to run this application. If multiple instances are present, the application will automatically select the first one it detects, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Application Build Environment

### Application Configuration Parameters

- Open sl_si91x_i2c_driver_leader.slcp project file select software component tab and search for i2c in search bar.
- Click on **I2C2** and configure the ULP_I2C instance as per configuration parameters given in wizard.
- For using any other I2C instance user has to add that I2C instance by clicking on **I2C Instance** from configuration wizard and then clicking on **Add New Instance**
- For creating I2C instances write 'i2c0', 'i2c1' or  'i2c2' (for ulp_i2c) on the wizard for respective instance and then click on **Done**. By default, 'i2c2' (for ulp_i2c) will be created.
- After creation of instances separate configuration files are get generated in **config folder**.
- If project built without selecting configurations, it will take default values from UC.
- Configure mode, operating-mode and transfer-type of I2C instance using respective instance UC.
- Change 'Operating Mode' as per bus-speed requirement.
-s After completing the above UC configurations, configure the following macros in [`i2c_leader_example.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_i2c_driver_leader/i2c_leader_example.c) and [`i2c_leader_example.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_i2c_driver_leader/i2c_leader_example.h) file. Update or modify the following macros, if required.

  ```C
    #define FOLLOWER_I2C_ADDR        // Update I2C follower address
    #define I2C_BUFFER_SIZE             // To change the number of bytes to send and receive.Its value should be less than maximum buffer size macro value.
  ```
  
> **Note:** After above configurations connect SCL and SDA pins of Leader and follower then run the application and observe the results by connecting SDA and SCL pins to logic Analyzer(if require, enable glitch filter for SCL channel with time period 100ns, to avoid glitches).

> **Note:** For I2C1 High Speed mode, modify the default GPIOs from `GPIO50 and GPIO51` to `GPIO54 and GPIO55` using the pintool / UC configuration.

- For getting proper speeds with fast and fast plus modes, please use external pullup of around 4.7K
- For high speed mode data transfer external pullup is must.
- Configure the UC as mentioned below.

> **Note- In case of sleep-wakeup :**
- As GPIO configurations will be lost after going to sleep state, user has to initialize I2C pins and driver again after wakeup, by using [sl_i2c_driver_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-i2c-driver-init) API for initializing driver and [sl_si91x_i2c_pin_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-c#sl-si91x-i2c-pin-init) API for initializing pins.

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. Connect SCL(ULP_GPIO_7) and SDA(ULP_GPIO_6) pins with the follower device.
3. When the application runs, it receives and send data.
4. After the transfer is completed, it validates the data and prints "Test Case Passed" on the console.
5. Will get "Test Case Passed" print on console.
6. Connect Analyzer channels to respective I2C instance SDA & SCA pins to observe the data on lines.
7. After successful program execution the prints in serial console looks as shown below.

> **Note:**
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
