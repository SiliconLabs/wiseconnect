description: |
  This application demonstrates how to configure and use the ICM40627 motion sensor, a 6-axis sensor that combines a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope. 
  The example covers how to initialize the sensor, configure its settings for various motion detection tasks, and retrieve sensor data for further processing, enabling motion-based applications.
