## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the 6-axis inertial sensor (ICM-40627), which measures the motion parameters and temperature every 2 seconds.

## About Example Code

This example demonstrates the measurement of acceleration in 3 axes, gyroscope in 3 axes, and temperature every 2 seconds. It also shows how to use various APIs available via the SPI interface.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002) + BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Serial console setup
  - The serial console setup instructions are provided in the
 [Console Input and Output](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#console-input-and-output) section of the *WiSeConnect Developer's Guide*.

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect 3 extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-the-wi-se-connect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#connect-si-wx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#update-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#create-a-project)

## Application Build Environment

- Configure the following macros in the `icm40627_example.c` file and update/modify following macros, if required.

- `DELAY_PERIODIC_MS1`: Select the delay for data display. By default, the delay is kept as 2 seconds.

    ```C
    #define DELAY_PERIODIC_MS1  2000      //sleeptimer1 periodic timeout in ms
    ```

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. When the application runs, it measures accelerometer, gyroscope and temperature data for every 2 seconds.
3. After successful program execution the prints in serial console looks as shown below.
