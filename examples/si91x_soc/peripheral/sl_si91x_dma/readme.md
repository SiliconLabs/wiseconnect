## Purpose/Scope

- This DMA example performs memory to memory DMA transfer of different sizes. User can change the DMA transfer size by updating SL_DMA_TRANSFER_SIZE in UC.
- This example used both simple DMA transfer API and generic API for performing DMA transfer.

## Overview

- DMA is used for performing transfers without processor intervention.
- Si91x DMA supports 3 types of DMA transfers. They are memory to memory, peripheral to memory, memory to peripheral.
- UDMA0 supports 32 channels. Out of which last 24 are dedicated channels for particular peripherals. First 8 channels can support 32 different peripherals.
- The number of transfers in a single DMA cycle can be programmed from 1 to 1024.
- The transfer address increment can be greater than the data width.
- UDMA1 only supports 12 channels.

## About Example Code

- \ref dma_example.c file demonstrates how to use DMA peipheral to perform memory to memory transfers
- In this example first dma initialization is done using \ref sl_si91x_dma_init
- Then \ref sl_si91x_dma_allocate_channel is used to allocate SL_DMA_CHANNEL for transfer. This SL_DMA_CHANNEL can be configured
  by UC
- After configuring channel, callbacks are registered using \ref sl_si91x_dma_register_callbacks
- In this example DMA transfer can be initiated by two methods,
  1.  Using \ref sl_si91x_dma_simple_transfer, user can quickly perform DMA transfer using bare minimum configurations.
  2.  Using \ref sl_si91x_dma_transfer, user can configure more DMA parameters for transfer
- User can either use any of above functions for performing DMA transfer. This can be selected by UC

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002) + BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Serial console Setup
  - The Serial Console setup instructions are provided below:
Refer [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-soc-mode#perform-console-output-and-input-for-brd4338-a).

### Setup Diagram

> ![Figure: Introduction](resources/readme/setupdiagram.png)

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- Open **sl_si91x_dma.slcp** project file select **software component**tab and search for **SL_DMA** in search bar.

  > ![Figure: result](resources/uc_screen/ucScreenDMA.png)

- Select DMA instance 0 or 1
- Select the DMA channel used for transfer (1 - 32).
- Select DMA transfer size in bytes (0 - 10000).
- Select transfer API type (simple/generic transfer API).

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Build the SI91x - SL_DMA example in Studio.
2. Flash, run and debug the application
3. Following prints should appear on console

> **Note:**
>
> - The debug feature of Simplicity Studio will not work after M4 flash is turned off.
> - To check Prints for DMA Peripheral examples, connect the USB to TTL uart connector's RX_pin, to the EXP_HEADER-7 of the WPK[BRD4002A] Base Board.
