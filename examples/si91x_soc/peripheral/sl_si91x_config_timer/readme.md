## Purpose/Scope

- This Config Timer example demonstrates two usecases of timer :
  - First as free running timer with GPIO toggle functionality. Counter-0 is configured to generate interrupts every millisecond and toggles GPIO.
  - Second as waveform generator producing two PWM outputs, counter-1 generates a square wave (50%-duty cycle) and counter-0 will produce a waveform whose duty cycle continuously varies from 100% to 0% then 0% to 100%, in steps of 1% at every 20 Milliseconds.

## Overview

- Configurable timers are used for counting clocks and events, capturing events on the GPIOs in input mode and outputting modulated signals. They can be programmed to work in Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) mode in which a pulse width modulated wave is driven on the outputs according to the programmed ON time and OFF times. Configurable Timers are present in MCU HP peripherals.
  - Each config counter(CT) sub-module of configuration timer(CT) can be configured to contain One 32 (or) two 16 bit timers.
  - There is a programming feature to select Clocks, events or external clock as a tick.
  - The input clock can be the reference clock or System clock.
  - Supports wide range of features like starting the counter, stopping the counter, continuing the counter from the stopped value, halt, increment the counter and capturing the events.
  - It can output PWM signals with any cycle/pulse length.
  - It can start a PPG in synchronous with PWM signal output. It can superimpose a PPGs output signal on the PWM signal and output it.
  - It can generate a non-overlap signal that maintains the response time of the power transistor(dead time) from PWM signal output.
  - It can capture timing of input signal changes and pulse width in synchronous with PWM signal.
  - It can start the ADC at any time, in synchronous with PWM signal output.
  - It performs noise cancelling of the emergency motor shutdown interrupt signal.
  - It can freely set the pin state at the time of motor shutdown, when a valid signal input is detected.
  - Supports APB interface for programming.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrated Config Timer as a normal counter, toggling GPIO on every interrupt and as PWM output generator.
- Two macros are present: CT_PWM_MODE_USECASE and CT_COUNTER_MODE_USECASE, by default normal counter use case is enabled.
- Enable any one of the below usecase macro at a time.
- If **CT_PWM_MODE_USECASE** is enabled:
  - Config Timer is initialized using \ref sl_si91x_ct_init() API.
  - After intialization, the desired counter parameters are configured using \ref sl_si91x_ct_set_configuration() API, the parameters are set through UC.
  - Match count for both the counters are configured using same @ref sl_si91x_ct_set_match_count() API.
  - Initial duty cycle is set for PWM channels \ref RSI_MCPWM_SetDutyCycle() API.
  - The desired OCU parameters are configured using \ref sl_si91x_ct_set_ocu_configuration() API.
  - The desired OCU controls for both counters, are configured using API \ref sl_si91x_config_timer_set_ocu_control(), by changing the counter number.
  - Registers callback for enabling peak interrupt, for counter-1 using \ref sl_si91x_ct_register_callback() API.
  - Starts both the counters using API \ref sl_si91x_ct_start_on_software_trigger(), by changing the counter number.
  - After enabling OCU mode, a continuous loop for pwm output is performed.
  - It creates 2 independent PWM Outputs - CT output-0 and CT output-1.
  - CT Output-1 will produce a square wave and CT Output-0 will produce a waveform whose duty cycle continuously varies from 100% to 0% then 0% to 100%, in steps of 1% at every 20 Milliseconds.
  - Connect logic analyzer to Evaluation kit board's GPIO-29 & GPIO-30 for output-0 and output-1 respectively and observe the PWM waveforms.
- If **CT_COUNTER_MODE_USECASE** is enabled:
  - First Configuring ULP_GPIO_1 pinmux mode and direction as output.
  - Config Timer is initialized using \ref sl_si91x_ct_init() API.
  - After intialization, the desired counter parameters are configured using \ref sl_si91x_ct_set_configuration() API, the parameters are set using UC.
  - Set the initial count value of counter using \ref sl_si91x_ct_set_initial_count() API.
  - Match count is configured using \ref sl_si91x_ct_set_match_count() API.
  - Registers callback for enabling peak interrupt for counter-0 using \ref sl_si91x_ct_register_callback() API.
  - Starts counter-0 using \ref sl_si91x_ct_start_on_software_trigger() API.
  - **Callback Function**
  - ULP_GPIO_1 pin gets toggled on every interrupt occurring at every millisecond and increments interrupt count.
  - When interrupt count is greater than ten, then timer is deinitialized, callback is unregistered and disables interrupt through \ref sl_si91x_config_timer_deinit() API.
