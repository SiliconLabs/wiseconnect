## Purpose

This application demonstrates the SHT4x sensor: relative humidity and temperature measurement via I2C every 1 second, and how to use the SHT4x APIs.

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#install-the-wiseconnect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#connect-siwx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#update-siwx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/using-the-simplicity-studio-ide#create-a-project)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- Configure the following macros in [`sht4x_example.c`](sht4x_example.c) file and update/modify following macros, if required.

  

  - `SHT4X_INIT_RETRIES`: Maximum number of retries that `sl_sht4x_init()` performs before giving up. By default, it is set to 10.

    ```c
      #define SHT4X_INIT_RETRIES  10                 // retries for sl_sht4x_init
    ```

  - `SHT4X_INIT_RETRY_MS`: Delay in milliseconds between consecutive `sl_sht4x_init()` retry attempts. By default, it is set to 1 ms.

    ```c
      #define SHT4X_INIT_RETRY_MS 1                  // delay between init retries
    ```

- `I2C instance`: Select I2C instance for communication through UC from the SHT4x Humidity and Temperature Sensor slcp component.
  By default I2C2 is selected.
- Make sure you install "SHT4x Humidity and Temperature Sensor" component.

### Pin Configuration

Tested on WPK Base board - 4002B and Radio board - BRD4338A.

| Description  | 917 GPIO  | Breakout pin |
| -------------| -----------| ----------|
| I2C_SDA      | ULP_GPIO_6 | EXP_16    |
| I2C_SCL      | ULP_GPIO_7 | EXP_15    |

Ensure the I2C instance (e.g. **i2c2**) is configured to use these pins.

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. When the application runs, it measures relative humidity and temperature for every 1 second.
3. Connect an oscilloscope to the Evaluation Kit board's ULP_GPIO_6(EXP16) / GPIO_6(EXP16) and ULP_GPIO_7(EXP15) / GPIO_7(EXP15) and observe the temperature and humidity data on I2C line.
4. After successful program execution, the prints in the serial console looks as shown below.

## Troubleshooting

- If the project does not build, ensure Simplicity Studio and the WiSeConnect extension are installed and the board is connected.
- If the device is not detected, reinstall the connectivity firmware and check USB drivers.
