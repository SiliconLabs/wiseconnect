label: SI91x - SL_I2C_Driver_Leader
description: |
  This application demonstrates how to use the I2C interface on the Si91x SoC device with blocking APIs. 
  It highlights the configuration of the I2C peripheral and shows how to send and receive data in a blocking mode, 
  which ensures that the system waits for a transaction to complete before proceeding to the next one.
