## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the ADC peripheral, including:

- Conversion of analog input to 12-bit digital output.
- Samples the data.
- Convert data into equivalent input voltage based on operation mode.

This application also switches between PS4 and PS2 power states, samples, collects, and displays ADC data.

## Overview

- The ADC Controller works on a ADC with a resolution of 12 bits at 10Msps when ADC reference Voltage is greater than 2.8v or 5Msps when ADC reference Voltage is less than 2.8v.
- The sample application will be 12-bit ADC Output in 2's complement representation.
- There are two operating mode in AUX ADC controller:
  - Static Mode Operation
  - FIFO Mode Operation
- There is a dedicated ADC DMA to support 16 channels.
- DMA mode supports dual buffer cyclic mode to avoid loss of data when buffer is full. In dual buffer cyclic mode, if buffer 1 is full for particular channel, incoming sampled data is written into buffer 2 such that, samples from buffer 1 are read back by controller during this time. That is why there are two start addresses, two buffer lengths and two valid signals for each channel.
- The AUX ADC can take analog inputs in single ended or differential. The output is 12-bit digital which can be given out with or without noise averaging.
- The Aux VRef can be connected directly to Vbat (Aux LDO bypass mode) or to the Aux LDO output.
- The user can configure input selection GPIO in the example application if default GPIO is work around.
- For ADC input selection rather than GPIO (like OPAMP, DAC, and Temperature sensor), users can create their own instances and configure them as per other input selection.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates ADC operation in FIFO and Static mode. It reads the sampled data and converts it into equivalent input voltage.
- You can configure various parameters like `Number of channel`, `ADC Operation Mode`, `Input Type`, `Sampling Rate`, and `Sample Length` using UC.
- The [`sl_si91x_adc_common_config.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/master/components/device/silabs/si91x/mcu/drivers/unified_api/config/sl_si91x_adc_common_config.h) file contains common configurations for ADC, and [`sl_si91x_adc_init_inst_config.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/master/components/device/silabs/si91x/mcu/drivers/unified_api/config/sl_si91x_adc_init_inst_config.h) contains the channel instance configuration.
- This example works in both FIFO and static mode of ADC operations.

- The firmware version of API is fetched using [sl_si91x_adc_get_version](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-get-version), which includes the release version, major version, and minor version [sl_adc_version_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-version-t).
- To initialize the ADC, call [sl_si91x_adc_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-init) API and pass the required parameters:[sl_adc_channel_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-channel-config-t), [sl_adc_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-config-t), and reference voltage value.
- Configure necessary parameters using the [sl_si91x_adc_set_channel_configuration](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-set-channel-configuration) API. This API expects a structure with required parameters: [sl_adc_channel_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-channel-config-t) and [sl_adc_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-config-t).
- After configuration, a callback register API is called to register the callback at the time of events [sl_si91x_adc_register_event_callback](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-register-event-callback).
- Start the ADC to sample the data using the [sl_si91x_adc_start](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-start) API.
- Once sampling is complete, the callback is triggered and sets `data_sample_complete_flag` to `true`. You can then read the sampled data using the [sl_si91x_adc_read_data](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-read-data) API for FIFO mode or [sl_si91x_adc_read_data_static](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-read-data-static) API for static mode. This process runs continuously.
- If ADC is started, it is recommended to stop it before de-initializing. This is general flow of API calls for ADC: [sl_si91x_adc_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-init) -> [sl_si91x_adc_start](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-start) -> [sl_si91x_adc_stop](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-stop) -> [sl_si91x_adc_deinit](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-deinit).

## Application Build Environment

Configure UC from the slcp component.

- Open the **sl_si91x_ulp_adc.slcp** project file, select the **Software Component** tab, and search for **ADC** in search bar.
- You can use the configuration wizard to configure different parameters. The configuration screen is below, with options for the user to pick based on need.

  - **ADC Peripheral Common Configuration**

    - Number of channel: By default channel is set to '1'. When the channel number is changed, then care must be taken to create instance of that respective channel number. Otherwise, an error is thrown.
    - ADC operation mode: There are 2 modes: FIFO mode and Static mode. By default, it is in FIFO mode. When static mode is set, sample length should be '1'.

  - **ADC Channel Configuration**

    - Input Type: ADC input type can be configured to be either single ended or differential.
    - Sampling rate: Sample rate can be configurable to ADC channel, sample rate unit is samples/second. The configuration range from 1sps to 2.5 Msps.
    - Sample length: Set the length of ADC samples (that is, the number of ADC samples collected for operation). It should be minimum value set to 1 and maximum of 1023.

      ![Figure: sl_adc_channel_uc_screen](resources/uc_screen/sl_adc_channel_uc_screen.png)

- After running the application, it will store the equivalent input voltage from ADC output samples in 'vout'.
- ADC output will print the configured number of samples output voltage on UART console.
- Apply the different voltages (1.8V to Vref) to ADC input and observe console outputs as per input.
- Provided input voltage and console output data should match.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. When the project is generated, the ADC channel by default is configured with the channel_1 instance for Si917 and the channel_2 instance for Si915. For further details, refer to the two sub-points below for the Si917 board and Si915 board.
   - Single-ended mode: the positive analog input to ULP_GPIO_1 for Si917 and GPIO_27 for Si915.
   - Differential modeL the positive analog input to ULP_GPIO_1 and the negative input to GPIO_28. For Si915, the positive analog input to GPIO_27 and the negative input to GPIO_30.
3. When the application runs, the ADC configures the settings as per the user and starts ADC conversion.
4. After completion of conversion ADC input, it will print all the captured samples data in console by connecting serial console.
5. After successful program execution, the prints in serial console looks as shown below when the input voltage provided is 3.3 v.
