## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the ADC peripheral, including:

- Conversion of analog input to 12-bit digital output.
- Samples the data.
- Convert data into equivalent input voltage based on operation mode.

This application also switches between PS4 and PS2 power states, samples, collects, and displays ADC data.

## Overview

- The ADC Controller works on a ADC with a resolution of 12 bits at 10Msps when ADC reference Voltage is greater than 2.8v or 5Msps when ADC reference Voltage is less than 2.8v.
- The sample application will be 12-bit ADC Output in 2's complement representation.
- There are two operating mode in AUX ADC controller:
  - Static Mode Operation
  - FIFO Mode Operation
- There is a dedicated ADC DMA to support 16 channels.
- DMA mode supports dual buffer cyclic mode to avoid loss of data when buffer is full. In dual buffer cyclic mode, if buffer 1 is full for particular channel, incoming sampled data is written into buffer 2 such that, samples from buffer 1 are read back by controller during this time. That is why there are two start addresses, two buffer lengths and two valid signals for each channel.
- The AUX ADC can take analog inputs in single ended or differential. The output is 12-bit digital which can be given out with or without noise averaging.
- The Aux VRef can be connected directly to Vbat (Aux LDO bypass mode) or to the Aux LDO output.
- The user can configure input selection GPIO in the example application if default GPIO is work around.
- For ADC input selection rather than GPIO (like OPAMP, DAC, and Temperature sensor), users can create their own instances and configure them as per other input selection.

## About Example Code

- This example demonstrates ADC in FIFO/Static mode of operation. It reads the sampled data and converts it into equivalent input voltage.
- Various parameters like Number of channel, ADC operation mode, Input Type, Sampling Rate and Sample Length can be configured using UC.
- The [`sl_si91x_adc_common_config.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/components/device/silabs/si91x/mcu/drivers/unified_api/config/sl_si91x_adc_common_config.h) file contains the common configurations for ADC and [`sl_si91x_adc_init_inst_config.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/components/device/silabs/si91x/mcu/drivers/unified_api/config/sl_si91x_adc_init_inst_config.h) contains the channel instance configuration.
- This example is working in both FIFO and static mode of ADC operations.

- The firmware version of API is fetched using [sl_si91x_adc_get_version](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-get-version), which includes the release version, major version and minor version [sl_adc_version_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-version-t).
- ADC initialize should call [sl_si91x_adc_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-init) API and pass parameters [sl_adc_channel_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-channel-config-t), [sl_adc_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-config-t) and reference voltage value.
- All the necessary parameters are configured using [sl_si91x_adc_set_channel_configuration](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-set-channel-configuration) API. It expects a structure with required parameters [sl_adc_channel_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-channel-config-t) and [sl_adc_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-adc-config-t).
- After configuration, a callback register API is called to register the callback at the time of events [sl_si91x_adc_register_event_callback](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-register-event-callback).
- Then start the ADC to sample the data using [sl_si91x_adc_start](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-start) API.
- Once sampling is done, the callback will hit and set the true "data_sample_complete_flag" flag to read the sampled data using [sl_si91x_adc_read_data](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-read-data) API for FIFO mode of ADC or [sl_si91x_adc_read_data_static](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-read-data-static) API for static mode of ADC. This process will run continuously.
- If ADC is started, it is recommended to stop it before de-initializing. This is general flow of API calls for ADC: [sl_si91x_adc_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-init) -> [sl_si91x_adc_start](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-start) -> [sl_si91x_adc_stop](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-stop) -> [sl_si91x_adc_deinit](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/adc#sl-si91x-adc-deinit).

## Application Build Environment

Configure UC from the slcp component.

- Open the **sl_si91x_ulp_adc.slcp** project file, select the **Software Component** tab, and search for **ADC** in search bar.
- You can use the configuration wizard to configure different parameters. The configuration screen is below, with options for the user to pick based on need.

  - **ADC Peripheral Common Configuration**

    - Number of channel: By default channel is set to '1'. When the channel number is changed, then care must be taken to create instance of that respective channel number. Otherwise, an error is thrown.
    - ADC operation mode: There are 2 modes: FIFO mode and Static mode. By default, it is in FIFO mode. When static mode is set, sample length should be '1'.
     - The user can install up to sixteen instances of the channel, which will execute in sequential order. To configure this, follow the steps below:

       1. Install the channel instances.
       2. Update the `Number of Channel(s)` value in the **ADC Peripheral Common Configuration** section and number of channels should be equal to the number of instances added in UC.
    - The order of instances must be strictly sequential, starting from 1 and increasing consecutively (e.g., 1, 2, 3). Non-sequential orders such as 1, 4, 6 or 1, 5, 2 are not permitted.


  - **ADC Channel Configuration**

    - Input Type: ADC input type can be configured to be either single ended or differential.
    - Sampling rate: Sample rate can be configurable to ADC channel, sample rate unit is samples/second. The configuration range from 1sps to 2.5 Msps.
    - Sample length: Set the length of ADC samples (that is, the number of ADC samples collected for operation). It should be minimum value set to 1 and maximum of 1023.

      ![Figure: sl_adc_channel_uc_screen](resources/uc_screen/sl_adc_channel_uc_screen.png)

- After running the application, it will store the equivalent input voltage from ADC output samples in 'vout'.
- ADC output will print the configured number of samples output voltage on UART console.
- Apply the different voltages (1.8V to Vref) to ADC input and observe console outputs as per input.
- Provided input voltage and console output data should match.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. When the project is generated, the ADC channel by default is configured with the channel_1 instance for Si917. For further details, refer to the two sub-points below for the Si917 board.
   - Single-ended mode: the positive analog input to ULP_GPIO_1 for Si917.
   - Differential modeL the positive analog input to ULP_GPIO_1 and the negative input to GPIO_28.
3. When the application runs, the ADC configures the settings as per the user and starts ADC conversion.
4. After completion of conversion ADC input, it will print all the captured samples data in console by connecting serial console.
5. After successful program execution, the prints in serial console looks as shown below when the input voltage provided is 3.3 v.

>- The required files for low-power state are moved to RAM; the rest of the application is executed from flash.
>- In this application, we are changing the power state from PS4 to PS2 and vice - versa.
>
> **Note:**
>
>- Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
>
> **Note:**
>
>- This application is intended for demonstration purposes only to showcase the ULP peripheral functionality. It should not be used as a reference for real-time use case project development, because the wireless shutdown scenario is not supported in the current SDK.
