## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the use of Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) for data transfer in full duplex in master mode in a FreeRTOS environment.

## Overview

- SSI is a synchronous, point-to-point, serial communication channel for digital data transmission.
- Synchronous data transmission is one in which the data is transmitted by synchronizing the transmission at the receiving and sending ends using a common clock signal.
- SSI is a synchronous four-wire interface consisting of two data pins (MOSI, MISO), a device select pin (CSN), and a gated clock pin(SCLK).
- With the two data pins, it allows for full-duplex operation with other SSI-compatible devices.
- It supports full-duplex, single-bit SPI master mode.
- It supports 6 modes:  
  - Mode 0: Clock Polarity is zero and Clock Phase is zero.
  - Mode 1: Clock Polarity is zero and Clock Phase is one.
  - Mode 2: Clock Polarity is one and Clock Phase is zero.
  - Mode 3: Clock Polarity is one and Clock Phase is one.
  - Mode-4: TEXAS_INSTRUMENTS SSI.
  - Mode-5: NATIONAL_SEMICONDUCTORS_MICROWIRE.
- The SPI clock is programmable to meet required baud rates.
- It can generates interrupts for different events like transfer complete, data lost, and mode fault.
- It supports up to 32K bytes of read data from a SSI device in a single read operation.
- It has support for DMA (Dynamic Memory Access).
- It can run in synchronous mode with full-duplex operation.
  - Master transmits data on MOSI pin and receives the same data on MISO pin.
- It also supports send and receive data with any SSI slave. Additionally, it also supports DMA and non-DMA transfer.
- For half-duplex communication (that is, send and receive), a master / slave connection is required.
- The SSI Master in MCU HP peripherals provides an option to connect up to four slaves and supports Single, Dual and Quad modes.

>**Note!** Make sure to use non-ROM SSI APIs for this application and SL_SSI driver.

## About Example Code

This example demonstrates SSI transfer (full-duplex communication) and SSI send/SSI receive (half-duplex communication) running as a dedicated FreeRTOS task.

- Various parameters like SSI clock mode, Bit-width, Manual cs pin, and SSI baud rate can be configured using the UC. Also, Master or Slave or ULP Master DMA can be configured using the UC.
- The [`sl_si91x_ssi_config.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.1.1-content-for-docs/components/device/silabs/si91x/mcu/drivers/unified_api/config/sl_si91x_ssi_config.h) file contains the control configurations, and [`sl_si91x_ssi_common_config.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.1.1-content-for-docs/components/device/silabs/si91x/mcu/drivers/unified_api/config/sl_si91x_ssi_common_config.h) contains DMA configuration selection.

### FreeRTOS Architecture

- On startup, `main.c` calls `app_init()` which invokes `ssi_master_example_init()`. This function creates the `ssi_master_task` FreeRTOS thread using `osThreadNew()`. The `app_process_action()` function is a no-op since all application logic runs inside the dedicated task.
- The `main.c` FreeRTOS flow calls `app_init()` followed by a `while (sl_main_start_task_should_continue())` loop that calls `app_process_action()` (no-op). The FreeRTOS scheduler manages task execution.

### Initialization (init_function)

- The output buffer is filled with data which is transferred to the slave.
- The firmware version of the API is fetched using [sl_si91x_ssi_get_version](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-get-version) which includes the release version, major version, and minor version [sl_ssi_version_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/sl-ssi-version-t).
- [sl_si91x_ssi_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-init) is used to initialize the peripheral, that includes pin configuration and it powers up the module.
- SSI instance must be passed in init function to get the instance handle [sl_ssi_instance_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-ssi-instance-t), which is used in other APIs.
- All the necessary parameters are configured using [sl_si91x_ssi_set_configuration](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-set-configuration) API. It expects a structure with required parameters [sl_ssi_control_config_t](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/sl-ssi-control-config-t).
- A binary semaphore (`ssi_transfer_sem`) is created using `osSemaphoreNew()` to signal transfer completion from the ISR callback to the task.
- A callback is registered using [sl_si91x_ssi_register_event_callback](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-register-event-callback). On `SSI_EVENT_TRANSFER_COMPLETE`, the callback releases the semaphore via `osSemaphoreRelease()`.
- Four serial slaves can be connected using this SSI master. For validation, you should change the slave number range from 0 to 3 in `ssi_master_freertos.c` and should enable the respective macro (for example, M4_SSI_CS0 for slave 0) in the `RTE_Device_917.h` file. (path: /$project/config/RTE_Device_917.h)

### Task Flow (ssi_master_task)

After initialization, the task configures `UULP_VBAT_GPIO_2` as a sync input and waits for a button press on the master sync line before it starts the first active phase. If a receive phase follows a transfer or send phase, the task waits for a second button press before it starts that receive phase. The task then runs the enabled transfer phases in sequence according to the macros in `ssi_master_freertos.h`:

>**Note:** The frequency of the SSI master bit-rate clock is one-half the frequency of SSI master input clock.

- If the **SSI_MASTER_TRANSFER** macro is enabled, it will transfer the data (that is, send and receive data in full-duplex mode).

  - Calls [sl_si91x_ssi_transfer_data](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-transfer-data) which expects data_out, data_in and number of data bytes to be transferred for sending and receiving data simultaneously (full duplex).
  - This test can also be performed in loopback state (that is, connect MISO and MOSI pins).
  - The task blocks on `osSemaphoreAcquire()` until the transfer complete event releases the semaphore. It then compares the sent and received data. The result is printed on the console.

- If the **SSI_MASTER_SEND** macro is enabled, it only sends the data to slave. The SPI slave must be connected; it cannot be tested in loopback mode.

  - Calls [sl_si91x_ssi_send_data](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-send-data) which expects data_out (data buffer that needs to be sent) and number of bytes to send.
  - The task blocks on `osSemaphoreAcquire()` until the send completes.

- If the **SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE** macro is enabled, it only receives the data from slave. SPI slave must be connected; it cannot be tested in loopback mode.

  - If receive follows an earlier transfer or send phase, the task waits for another `BTN0` press before it starts the receive phase.
  - Calls [sl_si91x_ssi_receive_data](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-receive-data) which expects data_in (empty buffer) and number of data bytes to be received.
  - The task blocks on `osSemaphoreAcquire()` until the receive completes, then compares the data.

- The enabled phases run in order in a single pass (no repeating loop). When finished, the task calls `osThreadExit()` to terminate.
- If any API call fails, the task prints an error via `DEBUGOUT` and calls `osThreadExit()` to terminate.

- You can use the configuration wizard to configure different parameters like:
  
   ![Figure: UC image](resources/uc_screen/ssi_uc_screen.png)

  - **SSI Primary(Master) Configuration**
    - Frame Format: SSI Frame Format can be configured:
      - Mode 0, Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3, Mode 4 and Mode 5.
    - Transfer Mode: SSI Transfer Mode will be `Single Line Mode` in this application.
    - Bit Rate: The speed of transfer is configurable. The configuration range is from 500Kbps to 40Mbps in high-power mode.
    - Data Width: The size of data packet. The configuration range from 4 to 16.
    - Mode: SSI mode/instance can be configurable. It can be configured Primary.
    - Rx Sample Delay: Receive Data (rxd) Sample Delay. This to delay the sample of the rxd input signal. Each value represents a single SSI clock delay on the sample of the rxd signal. The configuration range is from 0 to 63.
  - **SSI Primary(Master) DMA Configuration**
    - Primary DMA: DMA enable for SSI Primary mode. It will interface with a DMA Controller using an optional set of DMA signals.
    - Tx FIFO Threshold: Transmit FIFO Threshold. It controls the level of entries (or below) at which the transmit FIFO controller triggers an interrupt. The configuration range from 0 to 15.
    - Rx FIFO Threshold: Receive FIFO Threshold. It controls the level of entries (or below) at which the receive FIFO controller triggers an interrupt. The configuration range from 0 to 15.
- Configuration files are generated in **config folder**. If the values are not changed, the code will run on default UC values.

- Configure the following macros in the `ssi_master_freertos.h` file and update/modify following macros, if required.

- `SSI_MASTER_TRANSFER`: This macro is enabled default. It sends and receives data in full-duplex.

  ```c
    #define SSI_MASTER_TRANSFER ENABLE    // To use the transfer API
  ```

- `SSI_MASTER_SEND (or) SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE`: If SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE or SSI_MASTER_SEND is enabled, the SSI slave will receive and send data in half-duplex respectively.

  ```c
    #define SSI_MASTER_SEND     DISABLE   // To use the send API
    #define SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE  DISABLE   // To use the receive API
  ```

- By default, an 8-bit unsigned integer is declared for data buffer. If using a data-width more than 8 bit, update the variable to a 16-bit unsigned integer.

  ```c
  // For data-width less than equal to 8
  static uint8_t ssi_master_tx_buffer[SSI_MASTER_BUFFER_SIZE] = { '\0' }; 
  static uint8_t ssi_master_rx_buffer[SSI_MASTER_BUFFER_SIZE] = { '\0' };
  // For data-width greater than 8
  static uint16_t ssi_master_tx_buffer[SSI_MASTER_BUFFER_SIZE] = { '\0' }; 
  static uint16_t ssi_master_rx_buffer[SSI_MASTER_BUFFER_SIZE] = { '\0' };
  ```

- By default, CS0 is selected in the pintool. To use a different chip select (CS), update the corresponding slave number in the `ssi_master_freertos.c` file after configuring the desired CS in the pintool.

  ```c
  // For CS0
  static uint32_t ssi_slave_number = SSI_SLAVE_0; 
  // For CS1
  static uint32_t ssi_slave_number = SSI_SLAVE_1; 
  // For CS2
  static uint32_t ssi_slave_number = SSI_SLAVE_2;
  // For CS3
  static uint32_t ssi_slave_number = SSI_SLAVE_3;  
  ```

- Configure the following macros in [`ssi_master_freertos.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.1.1-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/platform_siwx91x_ssi_master_freertos/ssi_master_freertos.c) if required:

- `SSI_MASTER_BUFFER_SIZE`: Defines the length of data (in data-width units) to be sent or received through SPI. By default, it is set to 1024.

  ```c
  #define SSI_MASTER_BUFFER_SIZE          1024     // Length of data to be sent through SPI
  ```

- `SSI_MASTER_BIT_WIDTH`: Defines the SSI data bit width used for each transfer frame. By default, it is set to 8.

  ```c
  #define SSI_MASTER_BIT_WIDTH            8        // SSI bit width
  ```

- `SSI_MASTER_BAUDRATE`: Defines the SSI master baud rate (bit rate) in bits per second. By default, it is set to 10000000 (10 Mbps).

  ```c
  #define SSI_MASTER_BAUDRATE             10000000 // SSI baud rate
  ```

- `SSI_MASTER_MAX_BIT_WIDTH`: Defines the maximum supported SSI bit width used for buffer type selection. By default, it is set to 16.

  ```c
  #define SSI_MASTER_MAX_BIT_WIDTH        16       // Maximum bit width
  ```

- `SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE_SAMPLE_DELAY`: Defines the RX sample delay (in SSI clock cycles) applied to the receive data line. By default, it is set to 0.

  ```c
  #define SSI_MASTER_RECEIVE_SAMPLE_DELAY 0      // RX sample delay (SSI clocks)
  ```

- `PRIMARY_SECONDARY_SYNC_PIN`: Defines the GPIO used for button-based master/slave synchronization. By default, it is `RTE_UULP_GPIO_2_PIN`.

  ```c
  #define PRIMARY_SECONDARY_SYNC_PIN      RTE_UULP_GPIO_2_PIN
  ```

- To unregister a user event callback for a specific instance, use the API [sl_si91x_ssi_per_instance_unregister_event_callback](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-per-instance-unregister-event-callback). Alternatively, to unregister callbacks for all instances simultaneously, use the API [sl_si91x_ssi_unregister_event_callback](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ssi#sl-si91x-ssi-unregister-event-callback).

> **Note:** For reliable SSI operation, ensure that the peripheral clock is properly configured on both the **master** and **slave** sides. The SSI Primary (Master) peripheral clock (`ssi_clk`) must meet the following condition:
>
> F<sub>ssi_clk</sub> ≥ 2 × (maximum F<sub>sclk_out</sub>)
>
> Where F<sub>sclk_out</sub> is the bit rate output from the master. Make sure the SSI Primary (Master) peripheral clock (F<sub>ssi_clk</sub>) is set accordingly. Incorrect clock configuration may result in communication errors or unreliable data transfer.
>
> **SSI Secondary (Slave) Setup:** For instructions on configuring the SSI slave, refer to the [SSI slave](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.1.1-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ssi_slave/readme.md) to ensure correct setup and operation.

### Pin Configuration

**SSI Master Pin Configuration:**

| WPK [BRD4002A] + BRD4338A | Explorer kit (BRD2708A) | Description             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| GPIO_25 [P25]              | GPIO_25 [SCK]           | RTE_SSI_MASTER_SCK_PIN  |
| GPIO_28 [P31]              | GPIO_28 [CS]            | RTE_SSI_MASTER_CS0_PIN  |
| GPIO_26 [P27]              | GPIO_26 [MOSI]          | RTE_SSI_MASTER_MOSI_PIN |
| GPIO_27 [P29]              | GPIO_27 [MISO]          | RTE_SSI_MASTER_MISO_PIN |

`UULP_VBAT_GPIO_2` which is `BTN0` on WPK is connected to `F12`. This example uses that signal as the synchronization source on the master side.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [Getting Started with the WiSeConnect SDK](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. Connect the master SSI pins to the slave SSI pins as listed in [Pin Connections Between Master and Slave](#pin-connections-between-master-and-slave). On WPK hardware, connect `F12` on the master board to `F12` on the slave board for synchronization.
3. Reset the slave board and run or reset the master board.
4. When the master displays `Press button 0 on master to sync.`, press `BTN0` on the master board to start the first active phase.
5. If the enabled flow later reaches a receive phase after a transfer or send phase, press **BTN0** on the master board again when prompted to start the receive phase.
6. In loopback mode, remove the loopback jumper wire and run the test. Verify that the test reports data comparison fail and test case fail.
7. After the program runs successfully, the serial console output looks similar to the following.

   ![Figure: output](resources/readme/output.png)

> **Note:**
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.

## Troubleshooting

- If the project does not build, ensure Simplicity Studio and the WiSeConnect extension are installed and the board is connected.
- If the device is not detected, reinstall the connectivity firmware and check USB drivers.
