## Purpose/Scope

- This application demonstrate the BJT temperature sensor peripheral,
  - Conversion of 12-bit digital output into temperature in the range of -40 to 125 degree celsius.

## Overview

- BJT Temperature Sensor is useful to read the temperature by enabling the temperature sensor.
- The range it can read is from -40 to 125 degree celsius. Depending upon the digital output.
- voltage reference can be taken from 1.8 to 3.3 volts.
- When the application runs, the ADC configuration configures ADC.
- After the successful configuration of ADC, bandgap configuration read the OPAMP1 data.  
- Then BJT configure will enable the temperature sensor and reads the data. 
- By taking the calibrated data from adc_off, voltage band gap and voltage offset we are calculating the temperature value.
- After completion of conversion digital output, it will map to temperature conversion and then it will print all the captured samples data in console by connecting serial console.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002)+ BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Serial console Setup
  - The Serial Console setup instructions are provided below:
Refer [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-soc-mode#perform-console-output-and-input-for-brd4338-a).

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

### Application Configuration Parameters

- Configure the following parameters in sl_si91x_bjt_temperature_sensor.c (components\device\silabs\si91x\mcu\drivers\unified_api\src) file and update/modify following macros if required

  ```c
  #define CHANNEL_NUMBER             0       // channel number for adc
  #define POS_IP_OPAMP               20      // Positive input to ADC using OPAMP
  #define OPAMP_GAIN_OPAMP           51      // OPAMP gain value if opamp output is one of input to ADC
  #define OPAMP_CHANNEL              0       // opamp channel initializing with 0
  ```

### Pin Configuration

- Here mentioned pin numbers for BRD4338a (B0 2.0v boards) firmware version 18 board if user want to use different radio board, refer to board specific user guide.

  | INPUT SELECTION       | VALUE TO ADCP |
  | --------------        | ------------  |
  | OPAMP1_OUT            |         20    |     
  | OPAMP2_OUT            |         21    |
  | OPAMP3_OUT            |         22    |
  | TEMP_SENSOR_OUT       |         23    |

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. After successful program execution the prints in serial console looks as shown below.
