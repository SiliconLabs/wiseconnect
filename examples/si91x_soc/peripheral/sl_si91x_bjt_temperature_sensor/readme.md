## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the BJT temperature sensor peripheral, including the conversion of 12-bit digital output into temperature in the range of -40 to 125 degree Celsius.

## Overview

- BJT Temperature Sensor is useful to read the temperature by enabling the temperature sensor.
- The range it can read is from -40 to 125 degree Celsius, depending upon the digital output.
- Voltage reference can be taken from 1.8 to 3.3 volts.
- When the application runs, the ADC configuration configures ADC.
- After the successful configuration of ADC, the bandgap configuration reads the OPAMP1 data.  
- Then BJT configure will enable the temperature sensor and reads the data.
- By taking the calibrated data from adc_off, voltage band gap and voltage offset we are calculating the temperature value.
- After completion of conversion digital output, it will map to temperature conversion and then it will print all the captured samples data in console by connecting serial console.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

## Application Build Environment

### Application Configuration Parameters

- Configure the following parameters in `sl_si91x_bjt_temperature_sensor.c` (components\device\silabs\si91x\mcu\drivers\unified_api\src) file and update/modify following macros, if required.

  ```c
  #define CHANNEL_NUMBER             0       // channel number for adc
  #define POS_IP_OPAMP               20      // Positive input to ADC using OPAMP
  #define OPAMP_GAIN_OPAMP           51      // OPAMP gain value if opamp output is one of input to ADC
  #define OPAMP_CHANNEL              0       // opamp channel initializing with 0
  ```

### Pin Configuration

The following table lists the mentioned pin numbers for BRD4338a firmware version 18 board. If you want to use a different radio board, see the board-specific user guide.

  | INPUT SELECTION       | VALUE TO ADCP |
  | --------------        | ------------  |
  | OPAMP1_OUT            |         20    |
  | OPAMP2_OUT            |         21    |
  | OPAMP3_OUT            |         22    |
  | TEMP_SENSOR_OUT       |         23    |

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. After successful program execution the prints in serial console looks as shown below.

> **Note:**
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
