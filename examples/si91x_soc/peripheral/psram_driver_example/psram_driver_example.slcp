label: SI91x - SoC Peripheral PSRAM Driver Example
description: > 
  This example project demonstrates use of the PSRAM Driver APIs via 
  QSPI interface. The example writes and reads data to and from PSRAM
  using auto mode, manual blocking mode and DMA mode. The application
  makes use of default configurations of PSRAM device with fast quad 
  read and write in QPI (Quad IO) interface mode.
