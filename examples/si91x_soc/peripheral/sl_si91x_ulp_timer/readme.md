## Purpose/Scope

- This ULP_Timer example demonstrates the ULP-TIMER with LED toggle functionality. The timer instance is configured to generate interrupts upon expiration, which toggles LED0. Timer-0 is set to expire at 1-second (1Hz) intervals. ULP Timer expiration depends on the TIMER_MATCH_VALUE, which is configurable.  
- When the timer count matches the TIMER_MATCH_VALUE, the interrupt occurs, and the LED0 toggle can be seen. 

## Overview

- Timers are utilized for counting clocks, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, and minutes with both reference clock and system (SoC) clock. 
- The ULP-Timer module supports 4 timers, which can be used simultaneously to generate various timing events for the software.  
- Each of the ULP-timers can be independently programmed to operate in periodic or one-shot mode. Additionally, each ULP-timer can be configured independently as a 32-bit counter or as a microsecond timer. 
- In ULP mode, it runs at a 20MHz clock frequency and supports 1µs type, 256µs type, and normal down-counter type per timer. 
- The timers are programmed from the APB interface.

## About Example Code

- The [`ulp_timer_example.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/master/examples/si91x_soc/peripheral/sl_si91x_ulp_timer/ulp_timer_example.c) example file demonstrates how to use a ULP-timer instance to toggle the onboard LED at a 1-second periodic rate. 
- In this example, first, timer is configured with default high-power configuration values from UC through the [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-init) and [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_set_configurations](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-set-configurations) APIs respectively.  
- Match value is fetched based on timer type and TIME_IN_MICROSECONDS(Time in microseconds for which the match value needs to be calculated) using [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_get_match_value](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-get-match-value) API respectively. 
- Then, a callback is registered for the timer instance through the [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_register_timeout_callback](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-register-timeout-callback) API.  
- Next, the timer instance is started using the [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_start](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-start) API.  
- The onboard LED-0 is then toggled on every interrupt (timeout value 1 second), and after toggling the LED five times, the timer is stopped using the [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_stop](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-stop) API. 
- After that, the timer is configured with new parameters using the following APIs: 
- [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_set_type](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-set-type) to change the timer type to 256US type (time in microseconds/256) 
- [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_set_direction](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-set-direction) to change the timer direction to up-counting 
- [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_set_count](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-set-count) to change the match value equal to the number of ticks required for a 1-second timeout in 256US type 
- Then, the timer is started again, and after five interrupts, it will stop and switch to ultra-low-power state by calling the API [sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-power-manager-add-ps-requirement). As the interrupt is initialized with 5, it will configure the set type, direction, count, and toggle the LED-0 5 times. 
- Similarly, after toggling the LED-0 five times, it will stop the timer and switch back to high-power mode by calling [sl_si91x_power_manager_add_ps_requirement](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-power-manager-add-ps-requirement) and configure the set type, direction, count, and toggle the LED0 5 times before stopping the timer. 
- The callback is unregistered using the [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_stop](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-stop) API. Finally, the timer is deinitialized using the [sl_si91x_ulp_timer_deinit](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/ulp-timer#sl-si91x-ulp-timer-deinit) API.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the SL ULP Timer example in Studio.
- Flash, run and debug the application

  ![Figure: Onboard LED-0](resources/readme/image512d.png)
  
  ![Figure: ISP Switch](resources/readme/image512f.png)

- The evaluation kit board's LED0 will toggle five times at a 1-second periodic rate. 
- After toggling LED0 five times, the timer stops and is configured with new parameters, toggling LED0 five more times. 
- If the timer mode is 'one-shot' mode, LED0 will toggle only one time, and then the timer will stop. 
- After that, the timer is stopped and switches the power state from High power to Ultra-low power and is configured with new parameters, toggling the LED again five times. 
- Similarly, the timer is stopped and switches the power state from Ultra Low Power to High power and is configured with new parameters, toggling the LED again five times. 
- At the end of this example, the serial console prints "Unregistered timer timeout callback, on timer operation completion." 
- After successful program execution, the prints in the serial console look as shown below: 

  ![Figure: output_ulp_timer](resources/readme/output_ulp_timer.png)
  
**Note:**
>
>- The required files for low power state are moved to RAM rest of the application is executed from flash.
>- In this application we are changing the power state from PS4 to PS2 and vice - versa. 

> **Note:**
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
>
> **Note:**
>
>- This application is intended for demonstration purposes only to showcase the ULP peripheral functionality. It should not be used as a reference for real-time use case project development because the wireless shutdown scenario is not supported in the current SDK.
