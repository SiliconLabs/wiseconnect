## Test the Application

1. Sets the board state of RGB LED to ON and different set of colours can be observed.
 

> **Note:**
>
> - Currently, the RGB LED functionality is limited to a single instance.
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
