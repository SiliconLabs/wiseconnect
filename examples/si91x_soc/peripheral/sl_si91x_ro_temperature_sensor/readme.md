## Purpose/Scope

This sample app demonstrates the use of the RO temperature sensor. It prints the temperature on serial console.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002) + BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio
- Serial console Setup
  - The Serial Console setup instructions are provided below:
Refer [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-soc-mode#perform-console-output-and-input-for-brd4338-a).

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Install Studio and WiSeConnect 3 extension
- Connect your device to the computer
- Upgrade your connectivity firmware
- Create a Studio project

## Application Build Environment

- Configure the following macros in ro_temperature_sensor_example.c file and update/modify following macros if required.

  ```C
    #define NOMINAL_TEMP 25 // Calibrated temperature value
    #define COUNT_FREEZE 0xff // Count of reference clock on which ptat clock counts
    #define DELAY_MS1_PERIODIC 2000 //sleeptimer1 periodic timeout in ms
  ```

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Compile and run the application.
2. When the application runs, it measures temperature for every 2 seconds.
3. After successful program execution the prints in serial console looks as shown below.
