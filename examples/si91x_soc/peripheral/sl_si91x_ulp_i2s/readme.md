## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to configure ULP_I2S in PS2 state and master mode. This example connects the TX pin to RX pin in loopback mode.

The Master transmits data on the TX pin using DMA and receives the same data on a RX pin using DMA.

The data received should match the transmitted data.

## Overview

- The I2S_2CH supports two stereo channels, while the ULP_I2S and NWP/Security subsystem I2S support one stereo channel.
- Supported programmable audio data resolutions are 16-, 24-, and 32-bits.
- Supported audio sampling rates are 8, 11.025, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48, 88.2, 96, and 192 kHz.
- Supports Master and Slave modes.
- Full-duplex communication due to the independence of transmitter and receiver.
- Programmable FIFO thresholds with maximum FIFO depth of 8 and support for DMA.
- Supports generation of interrupts for different events.

## About Example Code

- This example fetches current I2S version using [sl_si91x_i2s_get_version](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-s#sl-si91x-i2s-get-version).
- Initializes I2S peripheral and stores driver handle in i2s_driver_handle using [sl_si91x_i2s_init](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-s#sl-si91x-i2s-init).
- Gets the transfer status of I2S peripheral using [sl_si91x_i2s_get_status](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-s#sl-si91x-i2s-get-status).
- Configures ARM power mode to full power using [sl_si91x_i2s_configure_power_mode](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-s#sl-si91x-i2s-configure-power-mode).
- Registers the user callback using [sl_si91x_i2s_register_event_callback](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-s#sl-si91x-i2s-register-event-callback).
- Configures transmitter and receiver transfer parameters for i2s using [sl_si91x_i2s_transmit_receive_config](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/3.5.0/wiseconnect-api-reference-guide-si91x-peripherals/i2-s#sl-si91x-i2s-transmit-receive-config).
- Configures receive DMA channel and prepares I2S for data receivings.
- Configures transmit DMA channel and sends data.
- When send data is received by the receiver channel, it compares the data received with transferred data.
- Loopback test will be passed after successful data comparison.
- Switches the power state from PS4 to PS2.
- Performs another loopback test.
- Switches the power state from PS2 to PS4.
- Performs another loopback test,

> **Note:** When utilizing the I2S1 instance in high-power mode with DMA enabled, it is advisable to allocate buffers in the ULP Memory block.

**Note!**

1. `sl_i2s_xfer_config_t` has following parameters:
   (a) **mode** - Configure I2S device in Primary (Master) /Secondary (Slave) mode.
   (b) **sync** - I2S synchronous mode (4-pin mode: SCK and WS signals are shared between I2S transmit and receive blocks) and asynchronous mode (requires SCK and WS pins). Currently, the driver only supports ASYNC mode.
   (c) **protocol** - I2S/PCM protocol. Currently, the driver only supports I2S protocol.
   (d) **resolution** - Audio data resolutions (16-, 24-, and 32-bit).
   (e) **data_size** - Transfer buffer data type (8-, 16- and 32-bit).
   (f) **sampling_rate** - Audio sampling rate.
   (g) **transfer_type** - Transfer type (Transmit, Receive, Transmit abort, and Receive abort).
2. Transfers with 16-bit resolution must use a `uint16_t` data type buffer and pass SL_I2S_DATA_SIZE16 to the data_size parameter in `sl_i2s_xfer_config_t` while configuring the transfer.
3. Transfers with 24-bit and 32-bit resolutions must use a `uint32_t` data type buffer and pass `SL_I2S_DATA_SIZE32` to the data_size parameter in `sl_i2s_xfer_config_t` while configuring the transfer.
4. Since 8-bit resolution is not supported, a `uint8_t` data type buffer can use 16-bit resolution for transfers and pass SL_I2S_DATA_SIZE8 to the data_size parameter in  `sl_i2s_xfer_config_t` while configuring the transfer. While performing this operation, the data buffer should be typecast to `(uint16_t *)`, and the transfer size should be half of the 8-bit data type buffer. (Refer to the I2S loopback application for more details.) For 8-bit transfers, the transfer size should be multiples of 4 (8,12,16,20...).
5. Any I2S transfers with 16-bit and 32-bit resolutions should only have an even transfer size (8,10,12,14...).
6. Any I2S transfers with 24-bit resolution should only have transfer size as multiples of 4 (8,12,16,20...).
7. The `I2S_LOOP_BACK` macro is used only for I2S loopback applications to avoid clock generation from the receiver block during transfer.
8. SCK frequency is calculated using `SCK = 2 * bit_width * sampling rate`. By default, I2S0 uses I2S_PLL_CLK as a clock source. This can generate any frequency range mentioned in section 6.11.7 of the Si91x HRM.

**Note**
> - The exact I2S clock frequency may not be achieved as intended because the integral part of the calculated division factor is written into register ignoring decimal part.
9. By default, ULP_I2S/I2S1 uses ULP_I2S_REF_CLK to support I2S operation in low-power states. This limits the maximum supported sampling frequency of ULP_I2S to 48kHz (32 MHz RC trims to 20MHz in  ULP_State).

- Using the configuration wizard, you configure different parameters like:

  - **General Configuration**

    - SL_ULP_I2S_RESOLUTION: ULP_I2S resolution can be configured through this macro. Valid resolution values are 16-, 24-, and 32-bit.

> **Note**: For recommended settings, see the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

1. Connect DOUT to DIN for loopback connection.
2. Compile and run the application.
3. When the application runs, it sends and receives data in loopback.
4. Data send/receive success and data comparison success prints can be seen on serial console.
5. After successful program execution, the prints in serial console looks as shown below.

   >![Figure: output](resources/readme/output.png)

>**Note:**
>
>- The required files for low-power state are moved to RAM and the rest of the application is executed from flash.
>- In this application, we are changing the power state from PS4 to PS2 and vice - versa.
>
> **Note:**
>
> - Interrupt handlers are implemented in the driver layer, and user callbacks are provided for custom code. If you want to write your own interrupt handler instead of using the default one, make the driver interrupt handler a weak handler. Then, copy the necessary code from the driver handler to your custom interrupt handler.
>
> **Note:**
>
>- This application is intended for demonstration purposes only to showcase the ULP peripheral functionality. It should not be used as a reference for real-time use case project development, because the wireless shutdown scenario is not supported in the current SDK.
