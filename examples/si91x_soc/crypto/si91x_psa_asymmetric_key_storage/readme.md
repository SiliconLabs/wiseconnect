## Purpose/Scope

- This application contains an example code to demonstrate the PSA asymmetric key storage functionality.
- This application uses hardware accelerator for key generation using ecc curve and ecdh calculation.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### Hardware Requirements

  - Windows PC
  - Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002)+ BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio

### Setup Diagram

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio.

### Application Configuration Parameters

 * PERSISTENT_KEY_ID in psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c file denotes key uid which will be stored in NVM3.
 * KEY_SIZE_BITS macro in psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c file is size of plain private key in bits.
 * KEY_MAX_SIZE is the max size of the key buffer used to store the generated public key.
 * Private_key in psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c file is the private key to be imported.
 * The public key generated will replace the private key in key_attributes.
 * Public_key in psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c is the public key generated and exported.
 * Default algo for asymmetric key generation is ECDH.
 * Default ecc curve is SEP256R1
 * Default key size is 256 bits - can choose between 192 and 256
 * To change the ecc curve and key size, change the corresponding macro in psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c - psa_set_key_type() and change the KEY_MAX_SIZE to the corresponding length of public key generated.

## Test the Application
