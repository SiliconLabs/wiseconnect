## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio.

### Application Configuration Parameters

 * PERSISTENT_KEY_ID in [`psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/crypto/si91x_psa_asymmetric_key_storage/psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c) file denotes key uid which will be stored in NVM3.
 * KEY_SIZE_BITS macro in [`psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/crypto/si91x_psa_asymmetric_key_storage/psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c) file is size of plain private key in bits.
 * KEY_MAX_SIZE is the max size of the key buffer used to store the generated public key.
 * Private_key in [`psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/crypto/si91x_psa_asymmetric_key_storage/psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c) file is the private key to be imported.
 * The public key generated will replace the private key in key_attributes.
 * Public_key in [`psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/crypto/si91x_psa_asymmetric_key_storage/psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c) is the public key generated and exported.
 * Default algo for asymmetric key generation is ECDH.
 * Default ecc curve is SEP256R1
 * Default key size is 256 bits - can choose between 192 and 256
 * To change the ecc curve and key size, change the corresponding macro in [`psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/crypto/si91x_psa_asymmetric_key_storage/psa_asymmetric_key_storage_app.c) - psa_set_key_type() and change the KEY_MAX_SIZE to the corresponding length of public key generated.
