For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio.

### Application Configuration Parameters

 * To use CTR/CBC algorithms, pass the respective PSA_ALG macro (PSA_ALG_CTR or PSA_ALG_CBC_NO_PADDING) as a parameter to `test_psa_aes()` in `app.c`
 * To use CTR/CBC algorithms, change encryption_output size to CIPHER_TEXT_SIZE
 * To use software fallback instead of hardware accelerators:
  - Add mbedtls_aes and mbedtls_cipher_xxx in component section of slcp file
  - Undefine the macro SLI_CIPHER_DEVICE_SI91X

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.
