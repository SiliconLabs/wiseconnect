### Software Requirements
  - GSDK version 4.3.2
  - Si91x SDK
  - Embedded Development Environment
    - For Silicon Labs Si91x, use the latest version of Simplicity Studio (refer **"Download and Install Simplicity Studio"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html**)
 
## Project Setup
- **Silicon Labs Si91x** refer **"Download SDKs"**, **"Add SDK to Simplicity Studio"**, **"Connect SiWx917"**, **"Open Example Project in Simplicity Studio"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio

## Build 
- Compile the application in Simplicity Studio using build icon

## Device Programming
- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio

## Executing the Application
- The current implementation will support AES-ECB single-part encryption and decryption.

### Configuration
 * To use CTR/CBC algorithms, pass the respective PSA_ALG macro as a parameter to `test_psa_aes()` in `app.c`
 * To use CTR/CBC algorithms, change encryption_output size to CIPHER_TEXT_SIZE

## Expected Results 
- The Encryption/Decryption function should produce the expected results.
