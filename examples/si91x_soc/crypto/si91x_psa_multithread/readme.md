## Purpose/Scope

- This application contains an example code to demonstrate the use of thread-safe mechanism while using crypto hardware accelerators.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

 - To use this application following Hardware, Software and the Project Setup is required

### Hardware Requirements

  - Windows PC
  - Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002)+ BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements
  - Simplicity SDK version: 2024.6.2
  - Si91x SDK
  - Embedded Development Environment
    - For Silicon Labs Si91x, use the latest version of Simplicity Studio (refer **"Download and Install Simplicity Studio"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html**)

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

- **Silicon Labs Si91x** refer **"Download SDKs"**, **"Add SDK to Simplicity Studio"**, **"Connect SiWx917"**, **"Open Example Project in Simplicity Studio"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio

### Application Configuration Parameters

- With default configuration, the application executes SHA and AES in two threads one after another.
- Set the priority of threads (thread0, thread1, thread2) to low, low4, low4 respectively to execute task1 and task2 applications one after another.
- Set the priority of threads (thread0, thread1, thread2) to low4, low, low respectively to execute the task1 and task2 application threads parallely in round-robin mode.
- Uncomment SAME_CRYPTO_ACCELERATORS and comment DIFFERENT_CRYPTO_ACCELERATORS in app.c to execute sha operation in both threads.

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.
- The current implementation executes AES-ECB single-part encryption and decryption for AES.
- The current implementation executes the SHA 256 hashing.
- The Encryption/Decryption function should produce the expected results.
- The SHA hashing should produce the expected result.
- The two threads should use semaphores for crypto accelerator functionalities.

### Expected output
- Run two threads of same crypto accelerators one after another
