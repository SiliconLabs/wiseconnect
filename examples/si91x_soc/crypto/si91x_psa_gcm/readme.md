## Purpose/Scope

- This application contains an example code to demonstrate the PSA GCM functionality.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### Hardware Requirements

  - Windows PC
  - Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002)+ BRD4338A]
  - For the Wrap Key feature of this application to work, the keys should be programmed and secure boot (ta_secure_boot) should be enabled in the device

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect 3 extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-the-wi-se-connect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#connect-si-wx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware ](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#update-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio

### Application Configuration Parameters

 * Wrapped key support is provided for AES,Chachapoly,HMAC,GCM with CBC/ECB mode. This example demonstrate the use of wrapped key with AES-GCM using wrap CBC mode.
 * To wrap the input key and use it, set WRAP_INPUT_KEYS macro to 1 in `psa_gcm_app.c`
 * To use a wrapped key directly, set IMPORT_WRAPPED_KEYS macro to 1 in `psa_gcm_app.c`
 * To use software fallback instead of hardware accelerators for plain key:
  - Add mbedtls_gcm in component section of slcp file
  - Undefine the macro SLI_AEAD_DEVICE_SI91X

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

### Expected output
