## Purpose/Scope

- This application contains an example code to demonstrate the PSA ECDH functionality
- This application uses hardware accelerators for key generation and shared secret computation using P256 and P192 ecc curve
- TRNG generation is done using hardware accelerator

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### Hardware Requirements	

  - Windows PC 
  - Silicon Labs [Si917 Evaluation Kit WSTK + BRD4325A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio

### Setup Diagram

- Create a Studio project

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio.

### Application Configuration Parameters

-  Default ecc curve is SEP256R1. 
-  Default key size is 256
-  To change the ecc curve and key size, set secpr1_key_size_select variable to the correct key_size in app.c

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:
