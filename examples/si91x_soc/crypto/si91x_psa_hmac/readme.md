## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect 3 extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-the-wi-se-connect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#connect-si-wx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware ](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#update-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project ](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#create-a-project)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio

The following MAC algorithms are supported in this example:
* `PSA_ALG_HMAC` (single-part)

### Application Configuration Parameters

The following hash algorithms are supported in this example:

* `PSA_ALG_SHA_1`
* `PSA_ALG_SHA_224` (Software Fallback)
* `PSA_ALG_SHA_256`
* `PSA_ALG_SHA_384`
* `PSA_ALG_SHA_512`

* To use software fallback instead of hardware accelerators for the other 4 algorithms:
  - Add mbedtls_shaxxx in component section of slcp file
  - Undefine the macro SLI_MAC_DEVICE_SI91X

> **Note**: For recommended settings, see the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application
