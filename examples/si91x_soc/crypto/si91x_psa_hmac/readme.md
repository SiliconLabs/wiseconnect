## Purpose/Scope

- This example uses the PSA Crypto API to perform Message Authentication Code (HMAC) operations on the supported device.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### Hardware Requirements

  - Windows PC
  - Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002)+ BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio

### Setup Diagram

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio

The following MAC algorithms are supported in this example:
* `PSA_ALG_HMAC` (single-part)

### Application Configuration Parameters

The following hash algorithms are supported in this example:

* `PSA_ALG_SHA_1`
* `PSA_ALG_SHA_224` (Software Fallback)
* `PSA_ALG_SHA_256`
* `PSA_ALG_SHA_384`
* `PSA_ALG_SHA_512`

* To use software fallback instead of hardware accelerators for the other 4 algorithms:
  - Add mbedtls_shaxxx in component section of slcp file
  - Undefine the macro SLI_MAC_DEVICE_SI91X

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

### Expected output
