For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- To program the device ,refer **"Burn M4 Binary"** section in **getting-started-with-siwx917-soc** guide at **release_package/docs/index.html** to work with Si91x and Simplicity Studio.

## Executing the Application

- Application tests the Following HMAC and CMAC modes:
  - HMAC-SHA-1
  - HMAC-SHA-256
  - HMAC-SHA-384
  - HMAC-SHA-512
  - CMAC-128
  - CMAC-192
  - CMAC-256

## Expected output

- All test cases should PASS.
