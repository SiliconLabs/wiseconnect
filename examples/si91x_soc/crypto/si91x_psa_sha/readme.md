## Purpose/Scope

- This application contains an example code to demonstrate PSA SHA.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

Before running the application, the user will need the following things to setup.

### Hardware Requirements

  - Windows PC
  - Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002)+ BRD4338A]

### Software Requirements

- Simplicity Studio

### Setup Diagram

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-the-wi-se-connect-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#connect-si-wx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware ](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#update-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project ](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#create-a-project)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- The user can run the application to verify the following SHA modes:
- SHA 1
- SHA 256
- SHA 384
- SHA 512
- Enable the desired SHA algorithm in [`psa_sha_app.h`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/v4.0.0-content-for-docs/examples/si91x_soc/crypto/si91x_psa_sha/psa_sha_app.h) by enabling the corresponding macro
- By defauit SHA 256 is enabled
* To use software fallback instead of hardware accelerators:
  - Add mbedtls_shaxxx in component section of slcp file
  - Undefine the macro SLI_SHA_DEVICE_SI91X

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run and debug the application.

### Expected output
- User will get the digest value.
