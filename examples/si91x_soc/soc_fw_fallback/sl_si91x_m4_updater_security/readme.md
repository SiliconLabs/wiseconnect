## Purpose/Scope

This application fetches the M4 application address from flash. If a valid address is obtained from slot information, it jumps to the M4 application; otherwise, it enters an infinite loop in case of failure.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### MBR Provisioning

> **Note:** Refer to UG625: SiWx91x Firmware Fallback User Guide before executing the reference examples.

Before using the A/B firmware fallback feature, the fallback profile must be enabled in the MBR on the device.

To enable firmware fallback for the devices using default MBR, use `commander manufacturing provision --mbr default --profile fallback -d <OPN>` command in the Simplicity Commander CLI tool.

To confirm the firmware fallback feature is enabled on the device, use `commander readmem --range 0x4000091:+1` command in the Simplicity Commander CLI tool and confirm the value to be 1.

For more details on firmware fallback feature enablement and usage, refer to UG625: SiWx91x Firmware Fallback User Guide.

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs SiWx91x Evaluation Kit [[BRD4002](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wireless-pro-kit-mainboard?tab=overview) + [BRD4338A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx917-rb4338a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board?tab=overview) / [BRD4342A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siwx91x-rb4342a-wifi-6-bluetooth-le-soc-radio-board?tab=overview) / [BRD4343A](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siw917y-rb4343a-wi-fi-6-bluetooth-le-8mb-flash-radio-board-for-module?tab=overview) / [BRD4343C](https://www.silabs.com/development-tools/wireless/wi-fi/siw917y-rb4343c-wi-fi-6-bluetooth-le-8mb-flash-radio-board-for-module?tab=overview)]

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-the-wi-se-connect-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#connect-si-wx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#update-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)
- [Create a Studio project](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#create-a-project)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

> **Note**: For recommended settings, please refer the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

1. Compile and run the application.
2. The application performs secure firmware management by retrieving A/B slot information, verifying both M4 and NWP firmware images at active slot addresses, loading QSPI keys for secure operations, performing NWP soft reset.
3. This application retrieves the active application flash offset and branches to the retrieved offset.

## Troubleshooting

- If the project does not build, ensure Simplicity Studio and the WiSeConnect extension are installed and the board is connected.
- If the device is not detected, reinstall the connectivity firmware and check USB drivers.
- If M4 application or secure verification fails, verify MBR fallback profile is provisioned, slot information in flash is valid, and QSPI keys are correctly configured.
