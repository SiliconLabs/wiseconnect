## Purpose/Scope

This application fetches the M4 application address from flash. If a valid address is obtained from slot information, it jumps to the M4 application; otherwise, it enters an infinite loop in case of failure.

> **Note**
>
>A/B firmware update functionality requires a special MBR and Patch to be preloaded on the device. Ensure these components are correctly loaded before running this example.

## Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- Windows PC
- Silicon Labs Si917 Evaluation Kit [WPK(BRD4002) + BRD4338A ]

### Software Requirements

## Test the Application

1. Compile and run the application.
2. The application performs secure firmware management by retrieving A/B slot information, verifying both M4 and NWP firmware images at active slot addresses, loading QSPI keys for secure operations, performing NWP soft reset.
3. This application retrieves the active application flash offset and branches to the retrieved offset.
