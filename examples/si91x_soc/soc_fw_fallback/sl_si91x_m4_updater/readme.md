## Purpose/Scope

This application fetches the M4 application address from flash. If a valid address is obtained from slot information, it jumps to the M4 application; otherwise, it enters an infinite loop in case of failure.

## Note
A/B firmware update functionality requires a special MBR and Patch to be preloaded on the device. Ensure these components are correctly loaded before running this example.
