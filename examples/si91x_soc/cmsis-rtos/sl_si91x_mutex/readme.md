## Purpose/Scope

- The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the use of CMSIS-RTOS concepts embedded with multiple peripherals. The following concepts are demonstrated:
  - Mutex
- This application contains an example code to demonstrate the GPIO/LED toggle functionality
- This example creates two threads for driving the same LED (which implies common resource)
- These threads run in parallel but are synchronized by Mutex for driving the LED

## Overview
 - One of the threads is intended only for turning on the LED, and other for turning it off
 - Each thread waits for acquiring the same Mutex. As soon as one acquires, it waits until current timeout is expired (keeping the LED state unchanged), then drives the LED (either on/off which the thread is intended to do)

## Getting Started

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- [Install Simplicity Studio](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-simplicity-studio)
- [Install WiSeConnect 3 extension](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#install-the-wi-se-connect-3-extension)
- [Connect your device to the computer](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#connect-si-wx91x-to-computer)
- [Upgrade your connectivity firmware ](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-developing-for-silabs-hosts/#update-si-wx91x-connectivity-firmware)

For details on the project folder structure, see the [WiSeConnect Examples](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-examples/#example-folder-structure) page.

## Application Build Environment

- Configure the following parameter in [`blinky.c`](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/master/examples/si91x_soc/cmsis-rtos/sl_si91x_mutex/src/blinky.c) file, update/modify following macro if required.

  ```C
    #define TOGGLE_DELAY_MS 500//  configured for 500 ms   
  ```   

> **Note**: For recommended settings, see the [recommendations guide](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-developers-guide-prog-recommended-settings/).

## Test the Application

1. Compile and run the application.
2. Sets the board state of LED0 to ON and OFF for configured blink rate.
3. LED0 should blink on WSTK/WPK base board.

  > **Note!**
  >
  > LED0 will continuously be turned on and off.
