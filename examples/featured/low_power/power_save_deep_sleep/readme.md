## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to enable power save deep sleep profile with SiWx91x. This application configures the SiWx91x in standby power save mode (Unassociated mode (NWP)) without RAM retention to reduce the current consumption.

Refer to the datasheet for current consumption values without RAM retention.

### Instructions for Keil IDE and STM32F411RE MCU (NCP Mode)

  - Install the [Keil IDE](https://www.keil.com/).
  - Download [WiSeConnect 3 SDK](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect).
  - Update the device's connectivity firmware as mentioned [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/getting-started-with-ncp-mode).
  - Connect the SiWx91x NCP to the STM32F411RE Nucleo Board by following these steps:
   	- Connect the male Arduino compatible header on the carrier board to the female Arduino compatible header on the STM32F411RE Nucleo board.
    - Mount the NCP Radio board (BRD4346A/BRD4357A) onto the radio board socket available on the base board (BRD8045C).
    - After connecting all the boards, the setup should look like the image shown below:
      ![Figure: Setup](resources/readme/stm32_setup.png)
   	- Connect the setup to the computer.
  - Open the POWERSAVE DEEP SLEEP µVision project - **power_save_deep_sleep.uvprojx** by navigating to **WiSeConnect 3 SDK → examples → featured → low_power → power_save_deep_sleep → keil_project**. 

## Application Build Environment

**Soc Mode**:

The M4 processor is set to sleep mode. To wakeup the M4 processor, use the method shown below:

- ALARM timer-based - In this method, an ALARM timer is run that wakes up the M4 processor periodically as configured in the Universal Configurator in 'Wakeup Source Configuration' under `WiseConnect 3 SDK v3.4.2 -> Device -> Si91x -> MCU -> Service -> Power Manager -> UULP Wakeup Sources -> PM Wakeup Source Configuration`, as shown below.

  ![Wakeup Source Configuration](resources/readme/wakeup_config_1.png)

  ![Alarm timer Configuration](resources/readme/wakeup_config_2.png)

- Configure the following parameter in **app.c**.

  - Power Profile

    ```c
    #define POWER_SAVE_PROFILE DEEP_SLEEP_WITHOUT_RAM_RETENTION
    ```

    > **Note** : By default DEEP_SLEEP_WITHOUT_RAM_RETENTION is enabled.

### Using Simplicity Studio Energy Profiler for Current Measurement
  
- After flashing the application code to the module, the Energy profiler can be used for current consumption measurements.

- From tools, choose Energy Profiler and click "OK".

    ![Figure: Energy Profiler Step 1](resources/readme/energy_profiler_step_1.png)

- From Quick Access, choose the Start Energy Capture option.

    ![Figure: Energy Profiler Step 2](resources/readme/energy_profiler_step_2.png)

    > **Note:** The target part and board name have to be reverted to default to flash application binary.
- Select board and click "OK".

  ![Figure: Energy Profiler Step 3](resources/readme/energy_profiler_step_3.png)
- Average current consumption measured in power-meter.

    ![output_prints](resources/readme/power_meter_avg_current_consumption.png)

> **Note:**
> - The reference images which are captured were measured in an isolated chamber and might vary in an open environment.
> - To achieve the lowest power numbers in unconnected sleep, in SoC mode, configure both NWP and M4 to sleep without RAM retention.
> - To achieve the datasheet number for the deepsleep with 352 k RAM retained, configure `RAM_LEVEL` to `SL_SI91X_RAM_LEVEL_NWP_BASIC_MCU_ADV` and M4 to sleep without RAM retention.
> - This can be configured by navigating to `WiseConnect 3 SDK v3.4.2 -> Device -> Si91x -> Memory Configuration`, as shown below:
>   ![set_ram_level_1](resources/readme/set_ram_level_1.png)
>   ![set_ram_level_2](resources/readme/set_ram_level_2.png)
> - A flash erase is required to flash any other application after the user runs the powersave application(s). If not, the module will not allow any application to be flashed.
