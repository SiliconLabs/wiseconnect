> Note: 
> The user can configure default region specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h'.

**Note!**
* This command must be used immediately after opermode request.
* Internally, the firmware maintains two tables.
    * Gain table holding Max Tx power values for all regions
    * Gain table with Max power vs offset values for each channel of all regions
* The five regions supported are FCC, ETSI, TELEC, KCC, and WORLDWIDE. These FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC gain table max power levels and offset values should be loaded in end-to-end mode via the BLE User Gain table. This has to be called upon every boot-up since this information is not saved inside flash. SoC uses these tables in FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC to limit power and avoid violating allowed limits.
* For Worldwide region, the firmware uses Worldwide values for Tx. For other regions (FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC), the firmware uses the min value out of Worldwide and Region based values for Tx. Also, there will be part-to-part variation across chips and offsets are estimated during manufacturing flow which will be applied as a correction factor during normal mode of operation.
* This frame must be used by customers who have done FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC certification with their own antenna. All other customers should not use this. Inappropriate use of this frame may result in violation of FCC/ETSI/TELEC/KCC or any certifications and Silicon labs is not liable for these uses.

* BLE power offset like <CHANNEL_NUM>, <1M_OFFSET>, <2M_OFFSET>, <500kbps_oFFSET>, <125kbps_oFFSET>

**req_type** can be set to one of the following macros :
```c
#define BLE_GAIN_TABLE_MAXPOWER_UPDATE 0
#define BLE_GAIN_TABLE_OFFSET_UPDATE   1
#define BLE_GAIN_TABLE_LP_CHAIN_0DBM_OFFSET_UPDATE  2
#define BLE_GAIN_TABLE_LP_CHAIN_10DBM_OFFSET_UPDATE 3
```
**node_id** refers to BLE Node id :
```c
#define BLE_NODE 0  // For selecting BLE node
```

The following arrays will be used to update_gain_table based on `node_id` and `req_type`.

| `node_id`  | `req_type`                    | Payload Array                                    |

| `BLE_NODE` | `UPDATE_GAIN_TABLE_MAX_POWER` | `Si917_BLE_REGION_BASED_MAXPOWER_XX`           |
| `BLE_NODE` | `UPDATE_GAIN_TABLE_OFFSET`    | `Si917_BLE_REGION_BASED_MAXPOWER_VS_OFFSET_XX` |
| `BLE_NODE` | `BLE_GAIN_TABLE_LP_CHAIN_0DBM_OFFSET_UPDATE` | `Si917_BLE_REGION_BASED_LP_CHAIN_0DBM_OFFSET_XX`           |
| `BLE_NODE` | `BLE_GAIN_TABLE_LP_CHAIN_10DBM_OFFSET_UPDATE`    | `Si917_BLE_REGION_BASED_LP_CHAIN_10DBM_OFFSET_XX` |

## Test the Application

### Instructions for Simplicity Studio IDE and Silicon Labs Devices (SoC and NCP Modes)

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.

### Instructions for Keil IDE and STM32F411RE MCU

- Build the application.
- Set the Docklight up by connecting STM32's Serial COM port. This enables you to view the application prints.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.

Follow the steps as mentioned for the successful execution of the application:

1. After the program gets executed, the Silicon Labs module starts BLE PER transmit or BLE PER receive.

2. The BLE-PER-RX can be validated between two SiWx91x device modes.
    - Configure an SiWx91x device in PER-TX mode and configure another SiWx91x device in BLE PER RX mode.

3. If the SiWx91x device is configured in BLE-PER-TX Mode, the SiWx91x device sends the packets with the configured mode in the configured channel.

4. Check the BLE PER stats to see if configured values are affected or not.

5. After successful program execution, the prints in Tera Term appear as shown in the following images.
