### Note

For NCP mode, following defines have to enabled manually in preprocessor setting of example project

- For 917A0 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1
- For 917B0 1.2 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1, CHIP_917B0 = 1
- For 917B0 2.0 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1, CHIP_917B0 = 1, SI917_RADIO_BOARD_V2 = 1 (This is enabled by default for all examples)
