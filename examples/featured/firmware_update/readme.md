# Firmware Update

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to update the SiWx91x firmware via Wi-Fi by downloading an image from a remote TCP server. The TCP server may be hosted on a local PC (as demonstrated in this example), or alternately on a cloud service such as Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure. The update process works as follows:

- The SiWx91x connects via Wi-Fi as a TCP client to a TCP update server
- The SiWx91x OTA application sends a firmware file request to the server and server responds with the firmware file
- The OTA application programs the firmware into the SiWx91x flash memory and reboots

## 2 Prerequisites/Setup Requirements

## 4 Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit your requirements and development environment.

### 4.1.1 In the Project explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network

- **STA instance related parameters**

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which Wi-Fi network that shall be advertised and Si91X module is connected to it.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
  	```

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the Access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
  	```

	- DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type of the Access point. The supported security modes are mentioned in `sl_wifi_security_t`.

  	```c
  	#define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE               SL_WIFI_WPA2 
    ```

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

### 4.1.2 TCP Configuration

```c
#define SERVER_PORT        5001        // TCP server port of the remote TCP server
#define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS  "172.20.10.3"  // Server IP address 
```
### 4.1.3 Combined Image Configuration 

```c
#define COMBINED_IMAGE    0        //Set 1 for combined image upgrade and 0 for TA firmware upgrade
```

### 4.2 Build the application

   **![Build as](resources/readme/build_project_soc.png)**

- NCP mode: Build as Firmware update Example

   **![Build as](resources/readme/build_project_ncp.png)**

### 4.3 Run and Test the application

## Build and run the TCP Server

  1. Copy the TCP server application [firmware_update_tcp_server_9117.c](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/master/examples/featured/firmware_update/firmware_update_tcp_server_9117.c) provided with the application source to a Linux PC connected to the Wi-Fi access point.
  2. Compile the application

> `user@linux:~$ gcc firmware_update_tcp_server_9117.c` -o ota_server.bin

  3. Run the application providing the TCP port number (specified in the SiWx91x app) together with the firmware file and path

> `user@linux:~$ ./ota_server.bin 5001 SiWx91x.NBZ.WC.GEN.OSI.x.x.x.rps`

... where [SiWx91x.NBZ.WC.GEN.OSI.x.x.x.rps](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect-wifi-bt-sdk/tree/master/firmware) is the firmware image to be sent to SiWx91x.

## Running the Application

After making any custom configuration changes required, build the application.

- Once the build was successful, right click on project and click on Debug As->Silicon Labs ARM Program as shown in below image.

  - SoC

    ![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/debug_as_soc.png)

  - NCP

    ![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/debug_as_ncp.png)

When the application runs and connects to the TCP server, the firmware image transfer occurs in chunks. The app requests a firmware chunk, the server sends the chunk, the app requests the next chunk, the server sends the chunk, and so forth until the entire transfer completes. As the transfer proceeds, progress is printed to the serial console. On completion, the console prints 'reach end of file'.

### 4.4 Application Output

![Figure: Log of firmware transfer](resources/readme/image157.png)

![Figure: Log of firmware transfer](resources/readme/output_soc.png)

When the firmware update completes, the SiWx91x should be rebooted after which it may take a few minutes to overwrite the old firmware with the new firmware in flash memory.

### Note

For NCP mode, following defines have to enabled manually in preprocessor setting of example project

- For 917A0 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1
- For 917B0 1.2 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1, CHIP_917B0 = 1
- For 917B0 2.0 expansion board, enable CHIP_917 = 1, CHIP_917B0 = 1, SI917_RADIO_BOARD_V2 = 1 (This is enabled by default for all examples)
