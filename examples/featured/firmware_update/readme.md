## Purpose/Scope

This application shows how to update the NWP firmware of a device via Wi-Fi by downloading the firmware file from a remote TCP server. The server can be run on a local PC. Here's how the update process works:

 - **Connection** : The device connects to a Wi-Fi network and acts as a TCP client.
 - **Request**    : The device sends a request to the TCP server for the firmware update file.
 - **Download**   : The server sends the firmware file to the device.
 - **Update**     : The device writes the new firmware to its memory and then restarts to complete the update.

This process allows the device to update its software over the air (OTA) without needing a physical connection.

  #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE               SL_WIFI_WPA2 
  ```

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

> Note: 
> You can configure default region specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h`

### TCP Configuration

```

### Combined Image Configuration

```c
#define COMBINED_IMAGE    0        //Set 1 for combined image upgrade and 0 for NWP firmware upgrade
```

## Test the Application

### Instructions for Simplicity Studio IDE and Silicon Labs Devices (SoC, and NCP Modes)

- When the firmware update completes, the SiWx91x should be rebooted after which it may take a few minutes to overwrite the old firmware with the new firmware in Flash memory.

### Steps to Create a Combined Image

  #### Case 1: When Security is Disabled

  1. Navigate to the Commander directory.

  2. Copy the NWP firmware image and M4 image into the Commander directory.

  3. Create the nwp_combined_image.rps file:

      ```c
      commander rps convert <nwp_combined_image.rps> --taapp <original non-encrypted TA rps> --combinedimage
      ```

  4. Create the m4_combined_image.rps file:

      ```c
      commander rps convert <m4_combined_image.rps> --app <original non-encrypted M4 rps> --combinedimage
      ```

  5. Create the final combined image:

      ```c
      commander rps convert <combined_image.rps> --app <m4_combined_image.rps> --taapp <nwp_combined_image.rps>
      ```

  #### Case 2: When Security is Enabled

  For devices with security enabled, additional signing and encryption steps are required. Follow the detailed instructions in **Section 6 - Combined Image (NWP + M4)** of the [UG574 SiWx917 SoC Manufacturing Utility User Guide](https://www.silabs.com/documents/public/user-guides/ug574-siwx917-soc-manufacturing-utility-user-guide.pdf#page=24).

### Build and Run the TCP Server (Linux PC)

  1. Copy the TCP server application [firmware_update_tcp_server_9117.c](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/blob/master/examples/featured/firmware_update/firmware_update_tcp_server_9117.c) provided with the application source to a Linux PC connected to the Wi-Fi access point.
  2. Compile the application
  
     ```c
	  user@linux:~$ gcc firmware_update_tcp_server_9117.c -o ota_server.bin
	  ```

  3. Run the application providing the TCP port number (specified in the SiWx91x app) together with the firmware file and path where [SiWG917-B.2.x.x.x.x.x.rps](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/tree/master/connectivity_firmware) is the firmware image to be sent to SiWx91x.

      ```c
      user@linux:~$ ./ota_server.bin 5001 SiWG917-B.2.x.x.x.x.x.rps
      ```

### Build and Run the TCP Server (Windows PC)

  1. Open the FIRMWARE UPDATE project in cygwin terminal - by navigating to **WiSeConnect 3 SDK → examples → featured → firmware_update**.  
  
  2. Compile the application

  3. Run the application providing the TCP port number (specified in the SiWx91x app) together with the firmware file and path where [SiWG917-B.2.x.x.x.x.x.rps](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/wiseconnect/tree/master/connectivity_firmware) is the firmware image to be sent to SiWx91x.

      ```c
      ./ota_server 5001 SiWG917-B.2.x.x.x.x.x.rps
      ```
