## Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates the procedure to measure WLAN UDP/TCP/TLS throughput by configuring the SiWx91x in client/server role.
In this application, the SiWx91x connects to a Wi-Fi access point, obtains an IP address, connects to iPerf server/client or Python-based TLS scripts, running on a remote PC, and measures Tx/Rx throughput transmitted/received from remote PC.

## Application Build Environment

The application can be configured to suit user requirements and development environment. Read through the following sections and make any changes needed.

### Configure sl_net_default_values.h

**File path for Simplicity Studio IDE:**
- In the Project Explorer pane, expand the **config** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. 

**File path for Keil IDE:**
- In the Project pane, expand the **resources/defaults** folder and open the **sl_net_default_values.h** file. 

Configure the following parameters to enable your Silicon Labs Wi-Fi device to connect to your Wi-Fi network:

- STA instance-related parameters:

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID refers to the name with which the Wi-Fi network shall be advertised. The Si91X module is connected to it.

    ```c
    #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_PROFILE_SSID               "YOUR_AP_SSID"      
    ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL refers to the secret key if the access point is configured in WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK security modes.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_CREDENTIAL                 "YOUR_AP_PASSPHRASE" 
      ```

  - DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE refers to the security type of the access point. The supported security modes are mentioned in `sl_wifi_security_t`.

      ```c
      #define DEFAULT_WIFI_CLIENT_SECURITY_TYPE               SL_WIFI_WPA2
      ```

- Other STA instance configurations can be modified if required in `default_wifi_client_profile` configuration structure.

> Note: 
> The user can configure the default region-specific regulatory information using `sl_wifi_region_db_config.h`.

**Path for app.c in Keil IDE:**

- Expand the **Application/User/Core** folder and open the **app.c** file.

**Path for app.c in Simplicity Studio IDE:**

- The app.c file will be located at **wifi_wlan_throughput_soc**.

Configure the following parameters in `app.c` to test the throughput app as per requirements.

  - Client/Server IP Settings

      ```c
      #define LISTENING_PORT     <local_port>       // Local port to use
      #define SERVER_PORT        <remote_port>      // Remote server port
      #define SERVER_IP  "192.168.0.100"    		// Remote server IP address
      #define SOCKET_ASYNC_FEATURE 1                // Type of Socket used. Synchronous = 0, Asynchronous = 1
      ```

  - Throughput Measurement Types

    - The application may be configured to measure throughput using UDP, TCP, or TLS packets. Choose the measurement type using the `THROUGHPUT_TYPE` macro.

      ```c
      #define THROUGHPUT_TYPE  TCP_TX     // Selects the throughput option

      #define TCP_TX           0   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TCP client
      #define TCP_RX           1   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote TCP server
      #define UDP_TX           2   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote UDP client
      #define UDP_RX           3   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote UDP server
      #define TLS_TX           4   // SiWx91x transmits packets to remote TLS server
      #define TLS_RX           5   // SiWx91x receives packets from remote TLS server
      ```

  - Throughput Test Options

## Test the Application

### Instructions for Simplicity Studio IDE and Silicon Labs Devices (SoC and NCP Modes)

Refer to the instructions [here](https://docs.silabs.com/wiseconnect/latest/wiseconnect-getting-started/) to:

- Build the application.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.

  > **Note:** The SiWx91x, which is configured as a UDP/TCP/TLS server/client, connects to the iPerf server/client and sends/receives data for configured intervals. While the module is transmitting/receiving the data, the application prints the throughput numbers in the serial console.

### Instructions for Keil IDE and STM32F411RE MCU

- Build the application.
- Set up the Tera Term by connecting STM32's Serial COM port. This enables you to view the application prints.
- Flash, run, and debug the application.
- The application prints appear as follows in the serial terminal.

**Note:**
>  The captured reference images are measured in an isolated chamber. However, variations can be observed if throughputs are measured in dense environments, i.e., in a dense environment, we can observe less throughput.
