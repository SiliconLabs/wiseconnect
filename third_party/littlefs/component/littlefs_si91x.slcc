description: >
  A little fail-safe filesystem. It's designed to handle random power failures, 
  with flash in mind, and provides wear leveling over dynamic blocks and to work 
  with a small amount of memory. RAM usage is strictly bounded, which means RAM 
  consumption does not change as the filesystem grows.
